To make AWS Glue Catalog information accessible to business users, you can set up an environment that provides a user-friendly view into the catalog, using dashboards, data portals, or query tools. Here are some approaches:

1. Create a Web Dashboard with AWS Glue Catalog Integration

Develop a web-based dashboard using tools like Dash, Streamlit, or React.

Use AWS SDK (boto3) in the backend to fetch Glue Catalog metadata (database schemas, table definitions, etc.).

Display this information in an interactive format that allows business users to explore the catalog, filter by schema or table, and view metadata details in a readable format.

Since you have a Dash application already, adding a new page to your Dash app that consumes Glue Catalog data is a natural fit. You could display data such as table names, column details, data types, and descriptions.


2. Use Amazon QuickSight for Business Reporting

Amazon QuickSight integrates with AWS Glue and can pull metadata for visualization.

Set up data source connections to tables in the Glue Catalog, and use QuickSight to create visuals or reports. This allows business users to access catalog metadata and potentially even run queries if necessary.

You can also control access to Glue data and QuickSight reports using AWS IAM, limiting what different users can see.


3. Set Up an AWS Data Portal with AWS Glue Integration

Use AWS DataBrew or Data Lake Formation to create a governed data lake environment.

DataBrew provides business-friendly data preparation and exploration capabilities, allowing users to see data profiles, preview data, and apply transformations.

For business users who need to find datasets across departments or teams, AWS Data Exchange (combined with Lake Formation) can be helpful, as it provides an organized, searchable environment for data.


4. Expose Glue Catalog Data in an SQL Query Tool (e.g., Amazon Athena)

AWS Athena is an interactive query service that lets you query Glue Catalog data using SQL.

Business users can use Athenaâ€™s web interface to explore data by writing queries on top of the Glue Catalog or even use tools like Tableau or Power BI with Athena for interactive dashboards.

For secure access, use AWS Lake Formation to control access to databases and tables within Glue, ensuring only relevant users have query capabilities.


5. Leverage a Third-Party Metadata Tool (e.g., Alation, Collibra)

Integrate a metadata management tool that connects with AWS Glue Catalog, providing features like catalog exploration, data lineage, and business glossary terms.

Many of these tools provide a rich user experience and offer features for non-technical users, such as simple search and filtering on metadata, descriptions, and relationships between datasets.


6. Use AWS Glue Data Catalog API for Custom Data Exploration Tools

If you need a highly customized experience, use the AWS Glue Data Catalog API to build your own front-end application tailored to the needs of business users.

By pulling data using the API, you can customize how Glue Catalog information is displayed, apply user-friendly labels, and even integrate with other data systems your users may need access to.


Tips for User-Friendly Presentation:

Add Business Context: Add descriptions, tags, and classifications to datasets in the Glue Catalog to make them more understandable.

Data Dictionary Integration: Integrate a data dictionary that explains field definitions, data types, and expected values.

Self-Service Querying: Allow trusted business users to run approved queries on specific datasets.
