Choosing between Spring Boot and Quarkus depends on your project's specific requirements. Here are some factors to consider:

1. Performance

Quarkus is designed for high-performance, low-latency environments, particularly for cloud-native and microservices architectures. It offers faster startup times and lower memory consumption, making it ideal for serverless applications or applications running in containers.

Spring Boot is more mature and versatile but tends to have slower startup times and higher memory consumption compared to Quarkus, especially in large-scale applications.


2. Ecosystem and Libraries

Spring Boot has a well-established and rich ecosystem with a broad range of libraries and tools for different domains (e.g., data access, security, messaging). It is widely adopted in enterprise applications, which makes it easier to find solutions to common problems.

Quarkus is relatively newer but offers good integration with popular libraries, especially in the microservices space. It focuses on a small, efficient runtime with libraries optimized for GraalVM and containerized environments.


3. Development Experience

Spring Boot offers a more mature development experience with a lot of documentation, tutorials, and a large community. It is a great choice for developers familiar with Spring and who need to leverage its extensive ecosystem.

Quarkus offers a modern development experience, with features like live reload, and is optimized for developer productivity. It also integrates well with GraalVM, offering native image generation, which can be beneficial for building cloud-native applications.


4. Cloud-Native and Microservices

Quarkus is built with cloud-native environments in mind. It works particularly well in Kubernetes or serverless environments where resource consumption (memory/CPU) and fast startup times are important.

Spring Boot is a strong choice for building microservices, especially if you're using Spring Cloud. It offers mature solutions for service discovery, configuration management, and messaging.


5. Community and Support

Spring Boot has a large, active community and a well-established support system, which can be beneficial for long-term enterprise projects.

Quarkus has a growing community and is backed by Red Hat, which ensures good long-term support and enterprise adoption.


6. Native Compilation

Quarkus excels at native compilation with GraalVM, allowing you to compile Java code into a native executable with much lower memory usage and faster startup times. This is especially useful for microservices in a cloud environment.

Spring Boot supports GraalVM, but Quarkus has tighter integration and better performance for native images.


7. Maturity vs. Innovation

Spring Boot is highly mature and widely used in production environments, making it a safe choice for large-scale, mission-critical applications.

Quarkus is more innovative, and while it is relatively new, it is gaining adoption for modern cloud-native applications, especially in Kubernetes and serverless environments.


When to Choose Spring Boot:

If you need a mature, feature-rich framework with wide community support.

If your application is already using Spring-related technologies (e.g., Spring Security, Spring Data).

If performance and memory usage are not the primary concerns for your application.


When to Choose Quarkus:

If you’re focused on cloud-native development, especially for containerized environments or serverless applications.

If you need extremely fast startup times and low memory footprint.

If you want to take advantage of GraalVM’s native compilation features for microservices.


Ultimately, your choice should be guided by the specific needs of your project in terms of performance, ecosystem, and cloud-native features.
