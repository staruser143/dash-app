Yes, Azure Logic Apps also manage state, but the way state is handled and stored differs from Azure Durable Functions. Let's break down how state is managed in Logic Apps, where it is stored, and how it compares to Azure Durable Functions.

1. Managing State in Azure Logic Apps

Azure Logic Apps are designed to automate workflows, integrate with various services, and handle long-running processes. State management in Logic Apps is implicit and largely handled by the platform itself. When an action in a Logic App is triggered, the platform automatically maintains the state of the workflow, including the progress and outputs of each action. This is particularly useful for scenarios such as waiting for an external input or performing an action on a schedule.

How State is Managed in Logic Apps:

Tracking State: As each step of a Logic App workflow is executed, the state is automatically stored and tracked by Azure Logic Apps. This includes information about each action, its status (success, failure), and its inputs and outputs.

Persistent State Across Steps: Logic Apps are built around workflows with multiple steps, and the state of each step is persisted in Azure's underlying infrastructure. The state includes the history and data passed between actions.

Long-Running Workflows: For long-running workflows, Logic Apps maintain state and can handle pauses (e.g., waiting for user input, approvals, or other events) while the workflow remains in a persistent state.


Where is the State Stored in Logic Apps?

In Azure Logic Apps, state is stored in Azure Storage by default. Specifically, state data is stored in Azure Blob Storage for long-running workflows. The storage is managed by the Logic Apps platform, and you don’t need to configure it explicitly for most use cases.

Azure Blob Storage: The workflow's state, including inputs and outputs for each action in the Logic App, is stored in Azure Blob Storage. This includes the execution history, status of the workflow, and any data passed between steps.

Retention: By default, Logic Apps retain execution history and state for 90 days. This is configurable if you want to retain data for a longer or shorter period.


Key Differences Between Logic Apps and Azure Durable Functions in Managing State:

Detailed Comparison:

1. State Handling:

Logic Apps manage state automatically as part of the workflow execution process. This includes tracking the execution history and inputs/outputs for each action in the workflow. Logic Apps are ideal for building workflows where the state management is abstracted from the user, allowing you to focus on defining the actions and triggers.

Azure Durable Functions, on the other hand, offer explicit control over state management. You write the code for orchestrators and activities, and you must manage how the state is saved, resumed, or manipulated across various function calls. This provides more flexibility but also requires more effort to handle state transitions, checkpoints, and retries.



2. Orchestration Complexity:

Logic Apps are better suited for business process automation and integration workflows, where the workflow logic is typically event-driven and involves less complex state management.

Azure Durable Functions excel in scenarios requiring complex workflows with multiple stages, dependencies, and parallel processing. They also allow for more fine-grained control over state, making them more suitable for scenarios like data pipelines or orchestrating tasks that require waiting for external events or long delays.



3. Storage:

In Logic Apps, state data (such as inputs, outputs, and the execution history of steps) is stored in Azure Blob Storage. This makes it easy to view and analyze the state of the workflow.

Azure Durable Functions store orchestration state and metadata in Azure Table Storage for efficiency in handling small, structured data related to the orchestration’s progress. Large or serialized state data, such as the results of activity functions, are stored in Blob Storage.



4. Execution History and Monitoring:

Logic Apps provide a visual interface for tracking the execution history, inputs, outputs, and success/failure status of each action within the workflow.

Azure Durable Functions require more manual intervention to view and manage the execution history. This is typically done through the Durable Task Framework’s built-in tools for tracking progress, or through logging in Application Insights.




Summary:

Logic Apps are ideal for automating workflows and integrating services where state is automatically managed, and the focus is on creating workflows with little code.

Azure Durable Functions are better for complex, stateful workflows that require explicit control over execution, state transitions, and handling of retries, failures, and external events.


In short, while both Logic Apps and Durable Functions manage state, Logic Apps offer a more abstracted, no-code/low-code approach with automatic state persistence, ideal for business processes and integrations. Durable Functions, on the other hand, offer fine-grained control over complex workflows, requiring more development effort but providing greater flexibility for custom orchestration logic.
