In Azure Cloud, the solution for storing static insurance plan data and accessing it efficiently across applications involves leveraging Azure's storage, database, and API services. Here's the recommended approach:


---

1. Storage Options

a. Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL Database)

Why?

Globally distributed, low-latency NoSQL database for read-heavy workloads.

Ideal for JSON-based static data with key-value or document structure.


Features:

Multi-region replication for high availability.

Cost-effective with serverless mode or throughput-based pricing.


Access:

Accessible via SDKs, REST API, or Azure Functions.

Supports multiple APIs (Core/SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra).



b. Azure Blob Storage (Object Storage)

Why?

Cost-efficient for storing static or semi-static data, such as JSON or Parquet files.

Excellent for batch processing or serving the entire list of plans.


Features:

Integrates with Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) for low-latency global distribution.

Supports versioning for tracking plan changes.


Access:

Use Azure REST APIs, SDKs, or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for advanced querying.



c. Azure SQL Database (Relational Database)

Why?

Best for structured data with complex relationships (e.g., linking plans to brokers or regions).

Familiar SQL interface for transactional queries.


Features:

Serverless options for cost-saving.

Advanced indexing for fast query performance.


Access:

Secure access via private endpoints or through an API layer.

2. Access Pattern for Applications

a. Azure API Management with Azure Functions

Purpose:

Provide a centralized API layer for accessing data.

Decouple storage from consuming applications.


Implementation:

Use Azure Functions to query Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, or SQL Database.

Deploy an API Management layer to expose consistent REST/GraphQL endpoints for applications.


Benefits:

Handles throttling, monitoring, and access control.

Supports caching for frequently accessed data.



b. Caching with Azure Cache for Redis

Why?

Improves performance for frequently accessed static data.

Reduces load on the underlying storage.


Use Case:

Cache the latest version of the insurance plans for fast retrieval.


Access:

Easily accessible via Redis protocols from applications.



c. Event-Driven Updates

Why?

Ensure all applications have the latest data when updates occur.


Implementation:

Use Azure Event Grid to trigger notifications or processing pipelines when data is updated.

Applications can refresh their cache or query updated data accordingly.



d. GraphQL API for Fine-Grained Access

Use Azure Static Web Apps with a built-in GraphQL endpoint or integrate with Azure Functions.

Applications fetch only the required attributes of a plan for optimal performance.

3. Recommended Architecture

1. Storage:

Use Azure Blob Storage for cost-effective static storage if data is primarily read in bulk (e.g., entire plan lists).

Choose Cosmos DB for low-latency access to individual plan records or attributes.

Use Azure SQL Database for relational or query-intensive needs.



2. Access Layer:

Deploy Azure API Management with a backend implemented using Azure Functions to serve REST/GraphQL APIs.

Add Azure Cache for Redis for fast, frequently accessed data.



3. Data Refresh:

Set up Azure Event Grid to notify or trigger updates for applications when new data is loaded.





---

4. Example Workflow

1. Plan Storage:

Insurance plans are stored as JSON in Azure Blob Storage (or in Cosmos DB for low-latency needs).



2. API Access:

Applications access plans via API Gateway or directly from Blob Storage using pre-signed URLs.



3. Caching:

Frequently accessed data is cached in Azure Cache for Redis.



4. Updates:

When a new plan is loaded, Event Grid triggers a refresh in dependent systems or updates caches.

Why This Works for the Insurance Broker Subdomain?

Static Data: Blob Storage provides low-cost and reliable storage for data that rarely changes.

Low-Latency Access: Cosmos DB or Redis ensures efficient, real-time access for applications requiring faster queries.

Integration-Friendly: Azure Functions and API Management make it easy to integrate storage with diverse applications.
