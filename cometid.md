Salesforce’s CometD routing bus is a part of its Streaming API, which allows you to subscribe to real-time data change events (such as Platform Events, Change Data Capture (CDC) events, or PushTopics) using the Bayeux protocol over long polling. You can incorporate CometD into this architecture to enable real-time integration between Salesforce and Azure’s Event-driven systems (Event Hubs and Event Grid).

Here’s how CometD can fit into your architecture with Event Hubs and Event Grid:


---

1. Architecture Overview with CometD

CometD acts as the event subscription and streaming bus from Salesforce.

Events published to CometD are captured by an intermediary (e.g., Azure Functions or Node.js-based service).

These events are routed into Azure Event Hubs for ingestion or Event Grid for routing.

This architecture enables Salesforce to publish real-time events and consume them in Azure services or external systems.

2. Detailed Workflow

Step 1: Event Publication in Salesforce

1. Salesforce publishes events such as:

Change Data Capture (CDC): Tracks changes to Salesforce records.

Platform Events: Publishes custom events.

PushTopics: Queries updates for specific Salesforce objects.



2. These events are routed through the CometD bus.



Step 2: Subscription to CometD in Azure

1. A CometD client subscribes to the Salesforce event stream.


2. This client can be implemented in:

Azure Functions.

A Node.js application (hosted on Azure App Service or a container).



3. The CometD client listens for real-time events published by Salesforce.



Step 3: Routing Events to Azure

1. The subscribed events are routed to:

Azure Event Hubs: For high-throughput, real-time ingestion and processing.

Azure Event Grid: To notify downstream systems (e.g., ReactJS/Node.js or custom data platform).

Both, depending on the use case.




Step 4: Processing Events in Azure

1. Events sent to Event Hubs are processed using:

Azure Functions.

Azure Stream Analytics.



2. Processed events are stored in the custom data platform (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Data Lake).


3. Events sent to Event Grid are routed to:

Salesforce (to trigger workflows or updates in external systems).

ReactJS/Node.js (to update the UI in real-time).




Step 5: Outbound Events to Salesforce

After processing, relevant data changes in Azure can be sent back to Salesforce using its REST API or Bulk API.

4. Using CometD in Node.js

To set up a CometD client in Node.js, you can use the cometd library to subscribe to Salesforce Streaming API events.

CometD Client Example

const faye = require('faye');
const axios = require('axios');

const salesforceURL = 'https://your-salesforce-instance.com/cometd/50.0';
const accessToken = '<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>';
const topic = '/event/MyPlatformEvent__e';

const client = new faye.Client(salesforceURL, {
  timeout: 120,
  retry: 5,
});

// Add Salesforce authentication
client.addExtension({
  incoming: (message, callback) => {
    if (message.channel === '/meta/handshake') {
      console.log('Handshake successful');
    }
    callback(message);
  },
  outgoing: (message, callback) => {
    if (message.channel === '/meta/handshake') {
      message.ext = {
        replay: true,
        authentication: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      };
    }
    callback(message);
  },
});

// Subscribe to the Salesforce topic
client.subscribe(topic, (event) => {
  console.log('Received event:', event);

  // Forward the event to Azure Event Hub
  axios.post('<AZURE_FUNCTION_OR_EVENT_HUB_URL>', event)
    .then(() => console.log('Event forwarded successfully'))
    .catch((err) => console.error('Error forwarding event:', err));
});

5. Scenarios with CometD in This Architecture

5.1. Ingest Salesforce Events into the Custom Data Platform

Use CometD to subscribe to Salesforce events (CDC, Platform Events).

Forward events to Event Hubs for high-throughput ingestion.

Process these events in Azure Functions or Stream Analytics.

Store processed data in Azure SQL or Data Lake.


5.2. Real-Time Notification to ReactJS/Node.js

Use CometD to subscribe to Salesforce Platform Events.

Forward events to Event Grid.

Event Grid notifies ReactJS/Node.js applications via webhooks or Azure Functions.


5.3. Synchronize Data Back to Salesforce

After processing data in the custom platform, push updates back to Salesforce using REST or Bulk APIs.
