Amazon Redshift can query data in Iceberg tables stored in Amazon S3 and join it with data in Redshift tables by using Redshift Spectrum. This approach allows you to keep your data lake in S3 while performing advanced analytics on it within Redshift, joining it with data in your Redshift data warehouse. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set this up and use it effectively:

1. Set Up AWS Glue Data Catalog as Your Metastore

Redshift Spectrum requires an AWS Glue Data Catalog to hold metadata about external tables, including Iceberg tables.

Register your Iceberg tables in the Glue Data Catalog. You can create these tables using Apache Spark on Amazon EMR or AWS Glue with the Iceberg library enabled, or directly through SQL commands.


-- Example to create an Iceberg table in Glue Data Catalog using Spark
spark.sql("""
    CREATE TABLE glue_catalog.my_database.my_iceberg_table (
        id INT,
        name STRING,
        created_at TIMESTAMP
    )
    USING iceberg
    LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/path/to/iceberg/'
""")

2. Grant Redshift Permissions to Access Glue and S3

Ensure that your Redshift cluster has the necessary IAM role with permissions to access both AWS Glue Data Catalog and Amazon S3. Attach this IAM role to your Redshift cluster.

The IAM role should include permissions like glue:GetTable, glue:GetDatabase, s3:ListBucket, and s3:GetObject.


3. Define an External Schema in Redshift to Access Glue Catalog

In Redshift, create an external schema that points to the Glue Data Catalog database where your Iceberg tables are stored. This allows Redshift to query Iceberg tables as if they were Redshift tables.


CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA iceberg_schema
FROM DATA CATALOG
DATABASE 'my_database'
IAM_ROLE 'arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:role/your-redshift-role'
REGION 'us-west-2';

4. Query Iceberg Tables Using Redshift Spectrum

Once the external schema is set up, you can query Iceberg tables in Redshift just as you would with regular Redshift tables. Redshift Spectrum reads the data directly from S3, using the Iceberg table’s metadata in Glue to understand the structure and location of the data files.


-- Example query on an Iceberg table
SELECT * FROM iceberg_schema.my_iceberg_table WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01';

5. Joining Iceberg Tables with Redshift Tables

You can join the data in Iceberg tables with the data in your Redshift data warehouse. This is especially useful for blending data lake and data warehouse data for analytics and reporting.


-- Example join between an Iceberg table and a Redshift table
SELECT r.id, r.name, i.created_at
FROM redshift_table r
JOIN iceberg_schema.my_iceberg_table i ON r.id = i.id
WHERE i.created_at > '2024-01-01';

6. Optimize Performance with Partition Pruning and Predicate Pushdown

When querying Iceberg tables through Redshift Spectrum, performance can be optimized by partitioning your Iceberg tables effectively. Iceberg’s metadata allows Redshift Spectrum to skip reading irrelevant partitions based on query filters.

This is especially valuable for queries on large tables, as it reduces the amount of data that Redshift Spectrum needs to scan, lowering both query times and S3 scan costs.


7. Considerations for Data Consistency

When working with external data in Iceberg tables, keep in mind that changes to the data in S3 (e.g., updates or schema changes) might not be immediately reflected in Redshift queries. You may need to refresh your Glue Data Catalog or re-synchronize Redshift if there are metadata changes.

For joins between Redshift and Iceberg tables, consider eventual consistency and ensure that data in both sources is consistent if data freshness is critical.


Summary

Using Redshift Spectrum to query Iceberg tables in Amazon S3 allows you to combine the scalability of a data lake with the performance and analytical capabilities of Redshift. This approach lets you join Iceberg table data with Redshift data warehouse tables, supporting a flexible and cost-effective data architecture.
