### ADR: Use of AsyncAPI and CloudEvents for Event-Driven Architecture

#### **Context**
Our organization is adopting an event-driven architecture to improve scalability, flexibility, and responsiveness. To standardize event communication and ensure interoperability across different systems and platforms, we are considering using AsyncAPI and CloudEvents.

#### **Decision**
We have decided to use **AsyncAPI** for defining and documenting event-driven APIs and **CloudEvents** for standardizing the event data format.

#### **Rationale**
- **AsyncAPI**: Provides a machine-readable format for defining event-driven APIs, similar to how OpenAPI does for REST APIs[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/async_standards_compare?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1"). It allows us to describe the structure of messages and the channels they are published to, ensuring clear communication between services[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/async_standards_compare?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").
- **CloudEvents**: Focuses on the event data itself, providing a common format for describing event data[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/asyncapi-cloud-events?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2"). This ensures that events can be easily understood and processed by different systems, regardless of the underlying technology[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/asyncapi-cloud-events?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").

#### **Benefits**
- **Interoperability**: Using CloudEvents ensures that event data is standardized, making it easier for different systems to communicate[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/asyncapi-cloud-events?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").
- **Clarity and Documentation**: AsyncAPI provides clear documentation of event-driven APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the system[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/async_standards_compare?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").
- **Flexibility**: Both AsyncAPI and CloudEvents are open standards, allowing us to integrate with a wide range of tools and platforms[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/async_standards_compare?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

#### **Considerations**
- **Learning Curve**: There may be a learning curve for developers who are new to these standards.
- **Tooling**: We need to ensure that our development and deployment tools support these standards.

#### **Implementation Plan**
1. **Training**: Provide training sessions for developers on AsyncAPI and CloudEvents.
2. **Integration**: Integrate AsyncAPI and CloudEvents into our development workflow.
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for our event-driven APIs using AsyncAPI.
4. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and logging to track event flow and ensure proper functioning.

#### **Next Steps**

Does this cover what you had in mind, or is there anything specific you'd like to add or modify?


Yes, using event sourcing is definitely supported when using AsyncAPI and CloudEvents together[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/02/simulating-cloudevents-asyncapi-and-microcks?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")! Event sourcing involves persisting the state of a business entity as a sequence of events, which can then be replayed to recreate the state. This approach fits well with an event-driven architecture[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/02/simulating-cloudevents-asyncapi-and-microcks?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

With **AsyncAPI**, you can define the event-driven APIs that will publish and consume these events[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://atamel.dev/posts/2023/05-23_asyncapi_cloudevents/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2"). **CloudEvents** standardizes the format of the event data, ensuring that the events can be easily understood and processed by different systems[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://atamel.dev/posts/2023/05-23_asyncapi_cloudevents/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").

By combining these two, you can create a robust event sourcing system where events are consistently formatted and communicated across your services[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://atamel.dev/posts/2023/05-23_asyncapi_cloudevents/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2"). This setup allows for better scalability, traceability, and flexibility in your architecture.

Great question! While REST APIs and event-driven architectures serve different purposes, they can be complementary. Here’s how AsyncAPI and CloudEvents can work alongside REST APIs:

### **Using AsyncAPI with REST APIs**
**AsyncAPI** is primarily for event-driven APIs, but it can be used in conjunction with REST APIs to provide a comprehensive view of your system's communication patterns. Here’s how:

- **Unified Documentation**: By using both OpenAPI for REST APIs and AsyncAPI for event-driven APIs, you can have a unified documentation system that covers all communication protocols in your architecture.
- **Complementary Roles**: REST APIs can handle synchronous requests (e.g., data retrieval or updates), while event-driven APIs defined by AsyncAPI handle asynchronous communication (e.g., event notifications).

### **Example Scenario**
Let's say you have a system where users can place orders. Here’s how you can integrate REST and event-driven APIs:

1. **REST API (OpenAPI)**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /orders`
   - **Purpose**: Allow users to place orders synchronously.
   - **Documentation**: Defined using OpenAPI.

2. **Event-Driven API (AsyncAPI)**
   - **Event**: `OrderPlacedEvent`
   - **Purpose**: Notify other services asynchronously when an order is placed.
   - **Documentation**: Defined using AsyncAPI.

### **Using CloudEvents with REST APIs**
**CloudEvents** standardizes event data, making it easier to process events regardless of the source. You can use CloudEvents to encapsulate event data when communicating between services that use REST APIs.

### **Example Scenario**
Continuing with the order placement example:

1. **Order Service**: 
   - Places an order using a REST API (`POST /orders`).
   - Publishes an event (`OrderPlacedEvent`) using CloudEvents to notify other services.

2. **Notification Service**:
   - Subscribes to `OrderPlacedEvent` via an event-driven API.
   - Sends a notification to the user once the event is received.

### **Benefits of Integration**
- **Consistency**: Using OpenAPI and AsyncAPI provides consistent and clear documentation for both REST and event-driven APIs.
- **Standardization**: CloudEvents standardizes the event data, making it easier for different systems to understand and process events.
- **Separation of Concerns**: REST APIs handle synchronous operations, while event-driven APIs handle asynchronous communication, leading to a more modular and scalable system.

The schema needs to be defined in a place which is stadard location accessible by both producers and consumers.what options do I have for the.


There are several ways to centrally store and manage schemas, ensuring they are accessible to both producers and consumers. Here are some popular options:

### **1. Schema Registry**
A schema registry is a centralized service for managing and storing schemas. It provides a RESTful interface for registering and retrieving schemas, ensuring that both producers and consumers use the correct schema versions.

**Examples:**
- **Confluent Schema Registry**: A well-known schema registry that supports Avro, JSON Schema, and Protobuf. It's often used with Apache Kafka but can be used independently as well.
- **AWS Glue Schema Registry**: A managed schema registry service provided by AWS, supporting Avro, JSON Schema, and Protobuf.

### **2. API Management Solutions**
API management solutions often provide features for managing schemas and API definitions in a centralized location. They offer tools for versioning, documentation, and access control.

**Examples:**
- **Apigee**: A full-featured API management platform by Google, which can store and manage API schemas.
- **Azure API Management**: A managed API gateway service provided by Microsoft Azure that supports storing and managing API definitions, including schemas.

### **3. Git Repositories**
Using a Git repository to store and manage schemas can be a simple and effective solution. Schemas can be versioned using Git's version control features, and access can be controlled through repository permissions.

**Example:**
- **GitHub**: Store schemas in a public or private repository, using branches and pull requests to manage schema changes.

### **4. AsyncAPI and OpenAPI Hubs**
Platforms that focus on API design and documentation can also be used to store and manage schemas.

**Examples:**
- **SwaggerHub**: A platform for designing and documenting APIs, supporting both OpenAPI and AsyncAPI. It allows you to store and manage schemas centrally.
- **AsyncAPI Hub**: A community-driven platform for sharing and discovering AsyncAPI definitions, which can include schema definitions.

### **Example: Using Confluent Schema Registry**

1. **Register Schema**: Producers register the schema before sending data.
   ```shell
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" \
        --data '{"schema": "{\"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"OrderPlacedEvent\", \"fields\": [{\"name\": \"orderId\", \"type\": \"string\"}, {\"name\": \"userId\", \"type\": \"string\"}, {\"name\": \"totalAmount\", \"type\": \"double\"}, {\"name\": \"orderDate\", \"type\": \"string\"}]}"}' \
        http://schema-registry:8081/subjects/order-placed-value/versions
   ```

2. **Retrieve Schema**: Consumers retrieve the schema to validate incoming data.
   ```shell
   curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" \
        http://schema-registry:8081/subjects/order-placed-value/versions/latest
   ```

### **Benefits**
- **Centralization**: Ensures that schemas are stored in a central location, reducing duplication and inconsistencies.
- **Versioning**: Provides version control for schemas, allowing for backward and forward compatibility.
- **Accessibility**: Makes schemas easily accessible to both producers and consumers, improving collaboration.

By adopting a schema registry or an API management solution, you can ensure that your schemas are standardized, version-controlled, and easily accessible.

Does this help clarify the options available? Do you have any specific preferences or constraints that we should consider?


If we have schemas in a registry,  how do we refer them in api specs.


Great question! Referring to schemas stored in a registry within your API specifications can help maintain consistency and avoid duplication. Here's how you can do it for both AsyncAPI and OpenAPI:

### **1. AsyncAPI**
AsyncAPI allows you to refer to external schemas using the `$ref` keyword. Here’s an example of how to refer to a schema stored in a schema registry:

**AsyncAPI Example:**

```yaml
asyncapi: '2.0.0'
info:
  title: Order Service
  version: '1.0.0'
channels:
  order/placed:
    subscribe:
      summary: Receive an order placed event
      message:
        contentType: application/json
        payload:
          $ref: 'http://schema-registry.example.com/subjects/order-placed-value/versions/latest/schema'
```

### **2. OpenAPI**
OpenAPI also uses the `$ref` keyword to refer to external schemas. Here’s an example of how to refer to a schema in a schema registry in an OpenAPI document:

**OpenAPI Example:**

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Order API
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  /orders:
    post:
      summary: Create an order
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: 'http://schema-registry.example.com/subjects/order-schema/versions/latest/schema'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Order created successfully
```

### **Details on How to Reference Schemas**
1. **Schema URL**: The `$ref` keyword is followed by the URL of the schema stored in the registry. Ensure that the URL points to the correct schema version in your registry.
2. **Schema Registry API**: Your schema registry should provide an API endpoint to retrieve the schema. The URL should point to this endpoint.

### **Benefits of Using Schema Registry References**
- **Consistency**: Ensures that all services use the same schema version, avoiding discrepancies.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralizes schema management, making updates easier and more efficient.
- **Version Control**: Allows you to refer to specific versions of schemas, ensuring compatibility between services.

By referencing schemas stored in a registry in your API specifications, you can maintain a consistent and reliable event-driven or RESTful architecture.

Is there anything else you’d like to know or any specific use case you have in mind?


When code is generated from these specifications, would the implementation include calls to registry to fetch them and use then for validation .


Yes, when generating code from specifications that reference schemas in a registry, the generated implementation can include calls to the registry to fetch schemas for validation. This approach ensures that the latest version of the schema is always used, maintaining consistency and compliance with the defined data structures.

Here’s a high-level overview of how this can work:

### **Code Generation and Schema Validation Workflow**
1. **Generate Code**: Tools like Swagger Codegen, OpenAPI Generator, and AsyncAPI Generator can be used to generate code based on your API specifications.
2. **Fetch Schema**: The generated code includes logic to fetch the schema from the registry. This is typically done during application startup or upon the first usage.
3. **Schema Validation**: Use the fetched schema to validate incoming and outgoing payloads, ensuring they conform to the expected structure.

### **Example Workflow with Schema Registry**

1. **API Specification (OpenAPI or AsyncAPI) Reference**:
   ```yaml
   paths:
     /orders:
       post:
         summary: Create an order
         requestBody:
           content:
             application/json:
               schema:
                 $ref: 'http://schema-registry.example.com/subjects/order-schema/versions/latest/schema'
   ```

2. **Generated Code (Pseudocode)**:
   ```python
   import requests
   import jsonschema

   # Fetch schema from registry
   schema_url = 'http://schema-registry.example.com/subjects/order-schema/versions/latest/schema'
   response = requests.get(schema_url)
   schema = response.json()

   # Validate incoming payload against schema
   def validate_payload(payload):
       try:
           jsonschema.validate(instance=payload, schema=schema)
           print("Payload is valid")
       except jsonschema.ValidationError as e:
           print(f"Payload validation error: {e.message}")

   # Example usage
   payload = {
       "orderId": "12345",
       "userId": "user-67890",
       "totalAmount": 99.99,
       "orderDate": "2025-01-22T12:53:00Z"
   }
   validate_payload(payload)
   ```

### **Benefits of This Approach**
- **Always Up-to-Date**: By fetching the schema from the registry, you ensure that your service uses the most up-to-date version of the schema.
- **Consistency**: Centralizing schema management in a registry ensures that all services use the same schema definitions, reducing discrepancies.
- **Validation**: Implementing schema validation helps catch errors early, improving the reliability and robustness of your application.

### **Considerations**
- **Performance**: Fetching the schema from the registry can introduce latency, especially if done frequently. Caching the schema locally can mitigate this.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling in case the schema registry is unavailable or returns an error.

By incorporating schema fetching and validation into your generated code, you can maintain a high level of consistency and reliability across your event-driven or RESTful architecture.

Does this help clarify how to implement schema fetching and validation? Would you like more detailed examples or have any other questions?
