When data is stored in Azure Blob Storage, you have several options to read and access it depending on the tools and services you're using. Here are some common options:

1. Azure SDKs:

You can use various Azure SDKs to interact with Blob Storage. SDKs are available for multiple programming languages like Python, .NET, Java, and JavaScript. These SDKs provide methods to access, read, and manipulate data in Blob Storage.



2. Azure Data Factory:

Azure Data Factory (ADF) can be used to create pipelines that read data from Blob Storage and process it. You can use ADF to move data to other storage or services, transform it, or load it into a data warehouse.



3. Azure Databricks:

You can mount Azure Blob Storage in Azure Databricks to read data into a Databricks notebook or workflow. Databricks supports reading and writing data in various formats such as CSV, Parquet, and Delta Lake.



4. Azure Synapse Analytics:

Azure Synapse Analytics allows you to access data stored in Azure Blob Storage using its SQL Pools or Spark Pools. You can read data using T-SQL or Spark SQL to query the data stored in Blob Storage.



5. Azure HDInsight:

HDInsight, a fully managed service for big data workloads, supports reading data from Azure Blob Storage. It's commonly used with Hadoop, Spark, or Hive.



6. Power BI:

Power BI can directly connect to Azure Blob Storage to read and visualize data stored in the blobs, especially for files like CSV or Parquet.



7. Azure Logic Apps:

Azure Logic Apps can be used to create automated workflows to read data from Blob Storage and trigger actions based on the data, such as processing or sending notifications.



8. Azure Functions:

Azure Functions can be used to read data from Blob Storage as part of an event-driven architecture. You can write functions that get triggered when new data is added or modified in Blob Storage.



9. REST API:

You can use the Azure Blob Storage REST API to programmatically interact with and read data stored in blobs. This is a low-level option that allows you to send HTTP requests directly.



10. Azure CLI or PowerShell:

You can use the Azure CLI or PowerShell to read blob data by issuing commands like az storage blob download or Get-AzStorageBlob.




The choice of tool or service depends on your use case, such as whether you're processing large volumes of data, integrating with other services, or simply accessing the data for analysis.
