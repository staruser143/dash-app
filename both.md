Using Azure Event Hubs and Azure Event Grid together in an architecture can create a robust and efficient solution for integrating Salesforce, ReactJS/Node.js, and a custom data platform in Azure. Each service serves a distinct purpose:

Azure Event Hubs: Primarily for high-throughput data ingestion and real-time streaming.

Azure Event Grid: Event routing service that enables event-driven communication between services.


Here’s a detailed breakdown of how both can be used together in the architecture:


---

1. Role of Event Hubs and Event Grid

1.1. Azure Event Hubs

Acts as a data ingestion layer for streaming data.

Use it for systems generating continuous streams of events:

ReactJS/Node.js: Can publish user activities, logs, or telemetry to Event Hubs.

Salesforce: Can send Change Data Capture (CDC) events or transactional data (via middleware if needed).


Enables real-time streaming and processing through consumers like Azure Functions, Apache Spark, or Azure Stream Analytics.


1.2. Azure Event Grid

Acts as a notification and event propagation layer.

Use it for reactive workflows triggered by discrete events:

When data is updated or processed in the custom data platform.

To notify Salesforce or ReactJS/Node.js systems of updates or changes.


Can route events to multiple endpoints like Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or custom webhooks.

2. How They Work Together in the Architecture

Scenario:

1. ReactJS/Node.js or Salesforce publishes events to the system.


2. Event Hubs ingests high-volume streaming events.


3. Event Grid propagates processed or trigger-based events to notify systems about state changes or updates.

3. Detailed Workflow

3.1. Data Ingestion via Event Hubs

1. ReactJS/Node.js:

Publishes high-throughput events (e.g., user transactions, interactions) directly to Event Hubs.

Example: Logging a user action in a ReactJS app.



2. Salesforce:

Sends change events (e.g., via CDC or APIs) to Event Hubs using middleware such as Azure Functions.

Example: An update in customer data triggers an event.





---

3.2. Event Processing

1. Custom Data Platform:

Subscribes to Event Hubs to process raw data in real time.

Processing logic (e.g., transformations, enrichment) is implemented using:

Azure Stream Analytics.

Azure Functions.

Apache Spark on Synapse.


Processed data is stored in Azure Data Lake, Azure SQL Database, or Cosmos DB.



2. Event Grid Notification:

Once processing is complete, the custom data platform publishes notifications to Event Grid.

Event Grid triggers downstream systems, such as:

Salesforce: To sync updated records.

ReactJS/Node.js: To refresh the UI or alert users.






---

3.3. Notification via Event Grid

1. ReactJS/Node.js:

Subscribes to Event Grid notifications (via webhooks or Azure Functions).

Example: Refreshes the UI when new data is available.



2. Salesforce:

Subscribes to Event Grid using middleware (e.g., Azure Functions or Logic Apps).

Example: Updates a Salesforce record when a customer’s transaction is processed in the Azure data platform.

4. Advantages of Combining Event Hubs and Event Grid

By combining them:

Event Hubs handles streaming data ingestion.

Event Grid routes processed or important state-change events to notify systems.



---

5. Example Use Case

Scenario: Customer Order Management

1. ReactJS/Node.js:

Publishes "Order Placed" events to Event Hubs.



2. Event Hubs:

Receives and buffers events.

Azure Stream Analytics processes these events to enrich order data.



3. Azure Data Platform:

Stores processed order data in Cosmos DB.



4. Event Grid:

Sends a notification:

To Salesforce: Updates the customer record with the new order.

To ReactJS: Triggers a "Thank You" page for the user.

6. Key Considerations

When to Use Event Hubs

For high-volume, real-time streaming scenarios.

For systems like ReactJS/Node.js that generate a continuous stream of events.

When data needs to be processed before notifying downstream systems.


When to Use Event Grid

For reactive, event-driven workflows.

To notify systems like Salesforce or ReactJS when specific changes or triggers occur.

When you need to fan-out events to multiple subscribers (e.g., Salesforce, external services, or logs).
