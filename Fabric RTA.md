Key Features of Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric

1. Data Ingestion (Streaming and Batch)

Streaming Ingestion:

Supports real-time ingestion from sources like:

Event Hubs

IoT Hub

Kafka


Handles high-velocity data streams for immediate processing and analysis.


Batch Ingestion:

Enables periodic ingestion for hybrid use cases combining real-time and batch data.



2. Data Processing (Event Streams and Complex Analytics)

Uses KQL-based queries (Kusto Query Language) for high-performance processing of real-time data streams.

Supports windowing functions to analyze trends, spikes, or anomalies over defined time intervals.

Allows transformation, enrichment, and aggregation of streaming data for use in dashboards or models.


3. Real-Time Analytics Database

Built on Azure Data Explorer (ADX) technology, the real-time analytics database in Fabric:

Is optimized for time-series and event-driven data.

Supports low-latency querying for real-time insights.

Provides robust indexing for efficient querying across massive datasets.



4. Integration with Other Fabric Workloads

Power BI Dashboards:

Seamlessly integrates with Power BI for real-time visualization and reporting.

Live connection to real-time analytics databases enables dynamic, auto-refreshing dashboards.


Data Engineering:

Process real-time data with pipelines and pass it to downstream workloads like data science or data warehousing.


OneLake:

Real-time data is stored in OneLake, ensuring unified access across all workloads in Fabric.



5. Built-In Machine Learning and Anomaly Detection

Provides support for integrating machine learning models into real-time pipelines for:

Predictive analytics.

Anomaly detection.

Trend forecasting.



6. Scalability and Performance

Designed to handle:

High-velocity data: Millions of events per second.

High concurrency: Large numbers of simultaneous queries.


Auto-scales to match workload demands, reducing operational complexity.


7. Monitoring and Observability

Integrated monitoring tools for real-time analytics pipelines, including:

Performance metrics (latency, throughput).

Error tracking and alerting.


Visualizes pipeline performance and bottlenecks to improve reliability.


8. Real-Time Data Actions

Allows triggering actions in response to events, such as:

Sending alerts.

Invoking workflows (e.g., triggering a Power Automate flow).

Updating external systems or dashboards.
