Adding a cache layer in front of Azure Cosmos DB can significantly enhance performance, reduce latency, and lower costs, especially for scenarios where:

1. Data is accessed frequently but rarely changes (e.g., static or semi-static plans data).


2. Query patterns involve repeated lookups for the same data by multiple clients.


3. Cost optimization is a priority, as caching reduces the number of Cosmos DB queries (and associated RU charges).


4. Global access is required, and a distributed cache can reduce latency for users in different regions.

When is a Cache Layer Needed?

Cache is Recommended If:

High traffic: Many clients access the same or overlapping data frequently.

Cost sensitivity: You aim to minimize Cosmos DB request units (RU) usage.

Low update frequency: The data doesnâ€™t change often, making caching straightforward.

Low latency is critical: A cache provides faster responses than querying Cosmos DB directly.


Cache is Not Necessary If:

The data changes very frequently (e.g., real-time updates).

The access patterns are highly random, with minimal overlapping queries.

Latency from Cosmos DB is already acceptable for your use case.

Options for Cache Layers

Here are some cache solutions to consider in Azure:


---

Recommended Approach

1. Azure Cache for Redis:

Best choice for scalable, low-latency caching of plans data.

Can store entire query results or frequently accessed rows.

Supports expiration policies (TTL) to refresh data periodically.



2. Cache Granularity:

Query-level caching: Cache the full query result for repeated requests.

Row-level caching: Cache individual plans or data subsets for high reuse.



3. Cache Invalidation:

Use a Time-To-Live (TTL) policy to refresh cache at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).

If data changes, use events (e.g., Cosmos DB Change Feed) to invalidate or update specific cached entries.

Example Architecture with Cache

1. Request Flow:

Client -> API Gateway -> Cache (Redis) -> Cosmos DB (only if cache miss).



2. Workflow:

On read: First, query the cache. If a cache miss occurs, retrieve the data from Cosmos DB and store it in the cache.

On update: Refresh or invalidate the cache entry whenever plans data changes.



3. Cost Benefits:

Significant savings on Cosmos DB RU charges by reducing read operations.

When Not to Use a Cache

If your data is highly dynamic, the overhead of keeping the cache updated may outweigh its benefits. In such cases, rely directly on Cosmos DB with optimized indexing and partitioning to meet performance needs.

By combining Cosmos DB's flexibility with a caching layer (e.g., Azure Cache for Redis), you can create a highly scalable, low-latency solution tailored to real-time data-serving scenarios.
