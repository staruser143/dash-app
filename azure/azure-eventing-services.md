Sure! Here are some scenarios for using **Azure Event Grid**, **Azure Event Bus**, and **Azure Event Hubs** in the Insurance Domain, focusing on the Broker Sub-domain:

### 1. **Azure Event Grid**
**Scenario:** Real-time notifications for policy updates.
**Example:** When a broker updates a client's insurance policy details, an event is published to Azure Event Grid. Subscribers (e.g., customer service applications, mobile apps) receive notifications about the policy changes in real-time, ensuring clients are always informed.

### 2. **Azure Event Bus**
**Scenario:** Reliable message delivery for claim processing.
**Example:** When a claim is submitted, it is sent to an Azure Service Bus Queue. Multiple claim processors (workers) can read from the queue and process the claims concurrently. This ensures reliable and scalable processing of insurance claims.

### 3. **Azure Event Hubs**
**Scenario:** High-throughput data ingestion for risk analysis.
**Example:** Insurance brokers collect vast amounts of data from various sources (e.g., IoT devices, customer interactions). This data is ingested into Azure Event Hubs, which can handle millions of events per second. The data is then streamed to analytics services for real-time risk assessment and reporting.

### Combination of Services
**Scenario:** End-to-end event-driven architecture for insurance brokers.
**Example:** 
1. **Data Collection:** IoT devices in vehicles send real-time driving data to **Azure Event Hubs**.
2. **Event Processing:** Data is processed and enriched using **Azure Functions** triggered by Event Grid.
3. **Notification:** Policyholders receive real-time notifications about their driving behavior and potential discounts via **Azure Service Bus**.

These scenarios leverage the strengths of each Azure messaging service to create a robust, scalable, and real-time event-driven architecture for insurance brokers. Does this help clarify how these services can be used in the insurance domain?


Great question! Both Azure Event Grid and Azure Event Bus have their strengths, but they are designed for different use cases. Let's break it down:

### **Azure Event Grid**
- **Primary Use:** Event Grid is designed for high-throughput event routing with low latency. It's great for scenarios where you need to notify multiple services or applications about an event.
- **Best For:** Real-time event notifications, lightweight events, and scenarios where events must be broadcast to multiple consumers (e.g., triggering workflows, real-time updates).

### **Azure Event Bus**
- **Primary Use:** Service Bus is designed for enterprise messaging with advanced messaging patterns. It provides reliable message delivery and supports scenarios where messages need to be processed in a certain order or with guaranteed delivery.
- **Best For:** Message queuing, scenarios requiring reliable message delivery, transactions, dead-lettering, and scenarios where message processing is crucial.

### **Why Use Azure Service Bus for Claim Submission**
1. **Reliable Delivery:** Claim submissions are critical, and you need to ensure that every claim is processed without any loss. Service Bus provides guaranteed delivery, which is essential for such scenarios.
2. **Message Ordering:** Some claim processing workflows may require messages to be processed in the exact order they were received. Service Bus supports message ordering, which is not a feature of Event Grid.
3. **Dead-Lettering:** In case a claim message cannot be processed, Service Bus can dead-letter the message for later investigation, ensuring no claims are lost.
4. **Transactions:** If your claim processing involves multiple steps or needs to be part of a larger transaction, Service Bus supports transactional messaging, which ensures all steps are completed successfully or rolled back.

In summary, while Azure Event Grid excels in routing lightweight, high-volume events to multiple subscribers, Azure Service Bus is better suited for scenarios that require reliable, ordered, and transactional message processing, making it more appropriate for claim submissions in the insurance domain.

Hope this clears up the differences! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.


Exactly! For business-critical scenarios where you need:
- **Message Ordering:** Ensuring messages are processed in the exact order they were sent.
- **Reliable Delivery:** Guaranteeing that no messages are lost.
- **Transactions:** Supporting transactions where all operations must either succeed or fail together.

**Azure Service Bus** is the right candidate because it offers:
- **Guaranteed Delivery:** Ensuring messages are delivered reliably, even in case of failures.
- **Support for Ordered Processing:** Making sure messages are processed in the correct order.
- **Transactional Messaging:** Allowing complex workflows with support for committing or rolling back transactions.

These features make Azure Service Bus ideal for scenarios like claim submissions in insurance, where the reliability and order of message processing are critical. 

Anything else you'd like to dive into or any other scenarios you'd like to explore?

For a scenario, where a process step is completed, and we want to notify interested parties about its status,asynchronously without caring about who actually reads the event or not or even if the message is lost, would Event Grids be an ideal candidate.

Absolutely! Azure Event Grid is a perfect fit for such scenarios. Here’s why:

### **Azure Event Grid for Asynchronous Notifications**
- **Event Routing:** Event Grid excels at routing events from a variety of sources to multiple subscribers, allowing for scalable and efficient distribution of notifications.
- **Asynchronous Communication:** Event Grid operates in a "fire-and-forget" manner, where the event publisher does not need to wait for event delivery confirmation. This is ideal for situations where you don’t care about who reads the event or if the event is lost.
- **Low Latency:** It provides low-latency event delivery, ensuring that interested parties receive notifications in near real-time.
- **Broad Integration:** It integrates with various Azure services and third-party services, making it flexible and easy to use for a wide range of scenarios.

### **Use Case Example**
**Scenario:** When a step in the insurance claim processing workflow is completed, an event is published to Event Grid. 
- **Publishers:** The claim processing service that generates events when a step is completed.
- **Subscribers:** Multiple services or applications (e.g., notification systems, logging services, analytics platforms) that are interested in the status updates.

This setup ensures that all interested parties can receive the status updates asynchronously without the claim processing service worrying about who actually reads the events or if any events are lost.

Event Grid’s ability to handle large volumes of events and its efficient event routing makes it an ideal candidate for such notification scenarios.

Does this answer your question? Is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding Azure Event Grid or other Azure services?

Is there a possibility , when using azure event grid, that the events could be lost , without anyone actually reading/processsing it before it is lost.


Yes, there is a possibility that events could be lost when using Azure Event Grid, but it largely depends on the configuration and implementation of your system.

### Potential Reasons for Event Loss
1. **Event Retention Period:** Event Grid retains events for a limited period (24 hours). If no subscribers process the event within this window, the event can be lost.
2. **Subscriber Failures:** If subscribers fail to process events due to errors, downtime, or misconfigurations, those events might not be read or processed.
3. **Delivery Attempts:** Event Grid makes multiple attempts to deliver an event to each subscriber. If all attempts fail, the event might not be delivered.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Dead-Lettering:** Configure dead-lettering for critical events. This ensures that undelivered events are stored in a dead-letter queue for later inspection and reprocessing.
- **Multiple Subscribers:** Have multiple subscribers for critical events to reduce the risk of events not being processed.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up monitoring and alerts to quickly identify and respond to issues in event processing.

For business-critical scenarios where event loss is unacceptable, you might want to consider using a combination of Event Grid and other services like Azure Service Bus for reliable message delivery.

          {"name": "amount", "type": "float"},
          {"name": "coverage", "type": "string"},
          {"name": "validity", "type": "string"}
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Using Schemas in Azure Services**

1. **Azure Event Grid:** 
   - Ensures that events adhere to a defined schema, making it easier for subscribers to understand and process the events.
   - JSON Schema is commonly used for defining the structure of events.

2. **Azure Service Bus:** 
   - Messages can be validated against the defined schema before being enqueued.
   - Ensures that consuming applications can reliably process messages as they conform to the expected structure.

3. **Azure Event Hubs:** 
   - Schemas like Avro provide a compact, efficient way to encode the structure of events, ensuring high-throughput data ingestion and processing.

By defining a standard format or schema for your messages/events, you can ensure consistency, reliability, and interoperability across your entire system, making it easier to manage and process data.

Does this help clarify the need for schemas? If you have more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!

=====

Here's a breakdown of how different Azure services can utilize schemas to validate and process messages/events:

### **1. Azure Event Grid**
**Using Schemas:**
- **Event Types:** Define your event schema as part of your Event Grid event type.
- **Validation:** Event Grid does not inherently validate schema, but you can use custom event handlers (e.g., Azure Functions) to validate the schema before processing.

**Example Integration:**
- **Custom Validation:** An Azure Function subscribed to an Event Grid topic validates the event against a predefined JSON schema before proceeding with the business logic.

```python
import jsonschema
from jsonschema import validate

# Define JSON schema
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "quoteId": {"type": "string"},
        "brokerId": {"type": "string"},
        "clientDetails": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "name": {"type": "string"},
                "age": {"type": "integer"},
                "address": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["name", "age", "address"]
        },
        "quoteDetails": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "amount": {"type": "number"},
                "coverage": {"type": "string"},
                "validity": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["amount", "coverage", "validity"]
        }
    },
    "required": ["quoteId", "brokerId", "clientDetails", "quoteDetails"]
}

# Validate JSON data against schema
def validate_event(event_data):
    try:
        validate(instance=event_data, schema=schema)
        return True, ""
    except jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError as err:
        return False, str(err)

event_data = # Event Grid event data
is_valid, error_message = validate_event(event_data)
```

### **2. Azure Service Bus**
**Using Schemas:**
- **Custom Code:** Service Bus does not inherently enforce schema validation, so it’s implemented in the message processing logic.
- **Validation:** Messages are validated against the schema within the consuming application (e.g., Azure Functions, Logic Apps).

**Example Integration:**
- **Custom Validation:** An Azure Function that processes messages from a Service Bus queue validates the message against a predefined schema.

```python
import jsonschema
from jsonschema import validate

# Define JSON schema
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "quoteId": {"type": "string"},
        "brokerId": {"type": "string"},
        "clientDetails": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "name": {"type": "string"},
                "age": {"type": "integer"},
                "address": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["name", "age", "address"]
        },
        "quoteDetails": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "amount": {"type": "number"},
                "coverage": {"type": "string"},
                "validity": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["amount", "coverage", "validity"]
        }
    },
    "required": ["quoteId", "brokerId", "clientDetails", "quoteDetails"]
}

# Validate JSON data against schema
def validate_message(message_data):
    try:
        validate(instance=message_data, schema=schema)
        return True, ""
    except jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError as err:
        return False, str(err)

message_data = # Service Bus message data
is_valid, error_message = validate_message(message_data)
```

### **3. Azure Event Hubs**
**Using Schemas:**
- **Schema Registry:** Use Azure Schema Registry to store and manage schemas for Avro or JSON.
- **Validation:** Consumers (e.g., stream processing applications) validate messages against the schema at runtime.

**Example Integration:**
- **Avro Schema Validation:** When using Avro, producers serialize data using the Avro schema before sending it to Event Hubs. Consumers deserialize and validate the data against the schema.

```python
import avro.schema
import avro.io
from io import BytesIO

# Define Avro schema
schema_json = '''
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "QuoteApplication",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "quoteId", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "brokerId", "type": "string"},
    {
      "name": "clientDetails", 
      "type": {
        "type": "record",
        "name": "ClientDetails",
        "fields": [
          {"name": "name", "type": "string"},
          {"name": "age", "type": "int"},
          {"name": "address", "type": "string"}
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "quoteDetails", 
      "type": {
        "type": "record",
        "name": "QuoteDetails",
        "fields": [
          {"name": "amount", "type": "float"},
          {"name": "coverage", "type": "string"},
          {"name": "validity", "type": "string"}
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
'''
schema = avro.schema.Parse(schema_json)

# Validate Avro data against schema
def validate_avro_data(avro_data):
    bytes_reader = BytesIO(avro_data)
    decoder = avro.io.BinaryDecoder(bytes_reader)
    reader = avro.io.DatumReader(schema)
    return reader.read(decoder)

avro_data = # Event Hubs message data
validated_data = validate_avro_data(avro_data)
```

### **Summary**
- **Azure Event Grid:** Custom validation in event handlers (e.g., Azure Functions).
- **Azure Service Bus:** Custom validation in message processing logic.
- **Azure Event Hubs:** Use Schema Registry and Avro for schema enforcement.

By implementing schema validation in your consuming applications or using schema registries, you can ensure consistent and reliable message processing across your Azure services.

I hope this helps clarify how schema validation works with these services! Feel free to ask if you have more questions or need further details.

**Azure Schema Registry** is a feature of Azure Event Hubs that provides a central repository for managing schemas used in event-driven and messaging-centric applications. It helps ensure that both producers and consumers of data use the same schema, which simplifies data serialization and deserialization.

### **Key Features of Azure Schema Registry:**
1. **Central Repository:** Stores schemas centrally, making it easy for producers and consumers to access and use the same schema.
2. **Schema Groups:** Organizes schemas into groups based on business criteria, allowing for better management and governance.
3. **Compatibility Modes:** Supports different compatibility modes (e.g., forward, backward) to ensure that schema updates do not break existing applications.
4. **Multiple Formats:** Supports various schema formats, including Avro and JSON.
5. **Security:** Provides a security boundary for schema groups, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.

### **How to Use Azure Schema Registry:**

#### **1. Create a Schema Group:**
- **Navigate to Event Hubs Namespace:** Go to the Azure portal and select your Event Hubs namespace.
- **Create Schema Group:** Select "Schema Registry" from the left menu and click on "+ Schema Group" to create a new schema group.
- **Configure Group:** Enter a name for the schema group, select the serialization format (e.g., Avro), and choose a compatibility mode.

#### **2. Add a Schema to the Group:**
- **Navigate to Schema Group:** Go to the schema group you created.
- **Create Schema:** Click on "+ Schema" to add a new schema.
- **Define Schema:** Enter the schema definition (e.g., JSON or Avro format) and click "Create".

#### **3. Use the Schema in Applications:**
- **Producers:** Serialize data using the schema stored in the registry before sending it to Event Hubs.
- **Consumers:** Deserialize data using the same schema to ensure data integrity and consistency.

### **Example Workflow:**
1. **Create Schema Group:** Create a schema group in the Azure Schema Registry.
2. **Add Schema:** Define and add a schema to the group.
3. **Produce Data:** Use the schema to serialize data in your producer application.
4. **Consume Data:** Use the same schema to deserialize data in your consumer application.

By using Azure Schema Registry, you can ensure that your data is consistently structured and validated, making it easier to manage and process across different services and applications.

Does this help clarify how to use Azure Schema Registry? If you have more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!



=====

You're right, Azure Schema Registry is part of Azure Event Hubs, but it can still be leveraged for other services like Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid. Here’s how you can use Azure Schema Registry with these services:

### **Using Azure Schema Registry with Other Services**

### **1. Register and Retrieve Schemas**
- **Step 1: Register Schemas:** First, register your schemas in the Azure Schema Registry as part of your Event Hubs namespace.
- **Step 2: Retrieve Schemas:** Use the Azure Schema Registry API to retrieve schemas for validation and serialization in your applications.

### **2. Azure Service Bus**
- **Producer Application:**
  1. **Retrieve Schema:** Use the Schema Registry API to retrieve the schema.
  2. **Serialize Message:** Serialize the message using the retrieved schema.
  3. **Send Message:** Send the serialized message to the Azure Service Bus queue or topic.

- **Consumer Application:**
  1. **Receive Message:** Receive the serialized message from the Azure Service Bus queue or topic.
  2. **Retrieve Schema:** Use the Schema Registry API to retrieve the schema.
  3. **Deserialize Message:** Deserialize the message using the retrieved schema for processing.

```python
# Example: Producer Application
from azure.eventhub.schema import SchemaRegistryClient

schema_registry_client = SchemaRegistryClient(endpoint="<event-hubs-namespace>.servicebus.windows.net", credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
schema = schema_registry_client.get_schema("schema-group", "schema-name", "schema-version")

# Serialize message using schema
serialized_message = ...  # Use the schema to serialize your message

# Send message to Service Bus
servicebus_client = ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string("<service-bus-connection-string>")
with servicebus_client.get_queue_sender("queue-name") as sender:
    sender.send_messages(ServiceBusMessage(serialized_message))

# Example: Consumer Application
received_message = ...  # Receive message from Service Bus
schema = schema_registry_client.get_schema("schema-group", "schema-name", "schema-version")

# Deserialize message using schema
deserialized_message = ...  # Use the schema to deserialize your message
```

### **3. Azure Event Grid**
- **Event Publisher:**
  1. **Retrieve Schema:** Use the Schema Registry API to retrieve the schema.
  2. **Serialize Event:** Serialize the event data using the retrieved schema.
  3. **Publish Event:** Publish the serialized event to Azure Event Grid.

- **Event Subscriber:**
  1. **Receive Event:** Receive the serialized event from Azure Event Grid.
  2. **Retrieve Schema:** Use the Schema Registry API to retrieve the schema.
  3. **Deserialize Event:** Deserialize the event data using the retrieved schema for processing.

```python
# Example: Event Publisher
schema_registry_client = SchemaRegistryClient(endpoint="<event-hubs-namespace>.servicebus.windows.net", credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
schema = schema_registry_client.get_schema("schema-group", "schema-name", "schema-version")

# Serialize event data using schema
serialized_event_data = ...  # Use the schema to serialize your event data

# Publish event to Event Grid
event_grid_client = EventGridPublisherClient.from_connection_string("<event-grid-connection-string>")
event_grid_client.send_events([EventGridEvent(data=serialized_event_data, event_type="eventType", subject="subject", data_version="1.0")])

# Example: Event Subscriber
received_event_data = ...  # Receive event data from Event Grid
schema = schema_registry_client.get_schema("schema-group", "schema-name", "schema-version")

# Deserialize event data using schema
deserialized_event_data = ...  # Use the schema to deserialize your event data
```

### **Benefits of Using Azure Schema Registry:**
1. **Consistency:** Ensures all services use the same schema, maintaining data integrity across the system.
2. **Validation:** Enables schema validation to ensure data conforms to expected formats.
3. **Interoperability:** Facilitates seamless communication between different services, even if they are not directly part of Event Hubs.

By leveraging Azure Schema Registry, you can maintain a consistent schema across various Azure services, ensuring reliable and efficient data processing.

Hope this clears up how to use Azure Schema Registry with other services! If you have more questions or need further details, feel free to ask.

Good question! Yes, including schema information with the event/data is a common practice to ensure that subscribers know which schema to use for validating and processing the data. This can be done in several ways:

### **1. Schema ID in the Event Metadata**
One effective approach is to include a schema identifier (schema ID) in the metadata of the event or message. This schema ID can then be used by subscribers to retrieve the correct schema from the Azure Schema Registry.

#### **For Azure Event Grid:**
- **Event Metadata:** Add a custom property to the event metadata that includes the schema ID.
- **Schema Retrieval:** Subscribers use the schema ID to retrieve the schema from the Schema Registry for validation and deserialization.

**Example: Publishing Event with Schema ID**
```python
event_grid_client = EventGridPublisherClient.from_connection_string("<event-grid-connection-string>")
event_data = {
    "quoteId": "12345",
    "brokerId": "67890",
    "clientDetails": {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "address": "123 Main St"},
    "quoteDetails": {"amount": 500.00, "coverage": "Full", "validity": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
}
event_metadata = {
    "schemaId": "schema-group/schema-name/schema-version"  # Include schema ID
}
event_grid_client.send_events([
    EventGridEvent(data=event_data, event_type="quoteSubmitted", subject="quote/12345", data_version="1.0", **event_metadata)
])

**Example: Subscriber Retrieving Schema**
```python
from azure.eventhub.schema import SchemaRegistryClient

# Receive event data from Event Grid
received_event = # Event from Event Grid
schema_id = received_event["schemaId"]  # Extract schema ID from event metadata

# Retrieve schema from Schema Registry
schema_registry_client = SchemaRegistryClient(endpoint="<event-hubs-namespace>.servicebus.windows.net", credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
schema = schema_registry_client.get_schema_by_id(schema_id)

# Validate and deserialize event data using the schema
validated_data = ...  # Validate and deserialize using the schema

#### **For Azure Service Bus:**
- **Message Metadata:** Include the schema ID in the message properties.
- **Schema Retrieval:** Subscribers use the schema ID to retrieve the schema from the Schema Registry for validation and deserialization.

**Example: Sending Message with Schema ID**
```python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClient, ServiceBusMessage

servicebus_client = ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string("<service-bus-connection-string>")
message_data = {
    "quoteId": "12345",
    "brokerId": "67890",
    "clientDetails": {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "address": "123 Main St"},
    "quoteDetails": {"amount": 500.00, "coverage": "Full", "validity": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
}
message_properties = {
    "schemaId": "schema-group/schema-name/schema-version"  # Include schema ID
}
serialized_message = ...  # Serialize message_data using the schema
message = ServiceBusMessage(serialized_message, **message_properties)

with servicebus_client.get_queue_sender("queue-name") as sender:
    sender.send_messages(message)

**Example: Consumer Retrieving Schema**
```python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClient

servicebus_client = ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string("<service-bus-connection-string>")
received_message = ...  # Receive message from Service Bus
schema_id = received_message.application_properties["schemaId"]  # Extract schema ID from message properties

# Retrieve schema from Schema Registry
schema_registry_client = SchemaRegistryClient(endpoint="<event-hubs-namespace>.servicebus.windows.net", credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
schema = schema_registry_client.get_schema_by_id(schema_id)

# Validate and deserialize message data using the schema
validated_data = ...  # Validate and deserialize using the schema

### **Benefits of Including Schema ID:**
- **Dynamic Schema Resolution:** Subscribers can dynamically retrieve and use the correct schema for validation and processing.
- **Decoupled Schema Management:** Changes to schemas are managed centrally, reducing the impact on producers and consumers.
- **Flexibility:** Supports different versions of schemas, allowing for backward and forward compatibility.

By including schema information with the event/data, you ensure that subscribers can accurately validate and process the data using the correct schema from the Azure Schema Registry.

I hope this clarifies how subscribers can know which schema to use! If you have more questions or need further details, feel free to ask.

Yes, there are costs associated with using Azure Schema Registry. The pricing is tied to the tier of your Azure Event Hubs namespace. Here's a brief overview:

### **Azure Event Hubs Tiers and Schema Registry Costs:**

| **Tier**       | **Schema Registry Availability** | **Cost**                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic**      | Not Available                    | Free tier, but does not support Schema Registry                     |
| **Standard**   | Available                        | Charges apply based on throughput units and storage usage           |
| **Premium**    | Available                        | Higher costs due to increased throughput and storage capabilities   |
| **Dedicated**  | Available                        | Custom pricing based on specific configurations and usage           |

### **Key Cost Components:**
1. **Throughput Units:** Costs are based on the number of throughput units consumed.
2. **Storage:** Charges for the amount of data stored in the schema registry.
3. **Retention:** Costs for data retention beyond the standard period.

For detailed pricing, you can refer to the [Azure Event Hubs Pricing Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/event-hubs/).

Would you like more information on how to estimate these costs for your specific use case?



==============

Throughput units (TUs) are a measure of the capacity you purchase to handle the amount of data ingress (events coming into Event Hubs) and egress (events going out of Event Hubs). Here's a breakdown of the cost component:

### **Throughput Units Cost:**
- **Standard Tier:** $0.03 per hour per Throughput Unit
- **Premium Tier:** $1.233 per hour per Processing Unit (PU)

### **What Does a Throughput Unit Represent?**
- **Ingress:** Up to 1 MB per second or 1,000 events per second (whichever comes first)
- **Egress:** Up to 2 MB per second or 4,096 events per second

### **Billing:**
- **Hourly Billing:** Throughput units are billed per hour. Once purchased, they are billed for a minimum of one hour.
- **Auto-Inflate:** Event Hubs can automatically scale up by increasing the number of throughput units to meet usage needs.

### **Example Calculation:**
If you have an application that ingests 2 MB per second of data, you would need at least 2 throughput units (since each unit supports up to 1 MB per second). If you run this application for 24 hours, the cost would be:

- **Standard Tier:** 2 TUs * $0.03/hour * 24 hours = $1.44
- **Premium Tier:** 2 PUs * $1.233/hour * 24 hours = $29.60

Would you like more details on how to estimate these costs for your specific use case?



============

Exactly! The costs associated with using Azure Schema Registry are primarily tied to the Azure Event Hubs pricing model, as the Schema Registry is a feature of Event Hubs. This means the primary cost components are the throughput units (TUs) for data ingress and egress, along with storage and retention, rather than a specific charge for the schema registry itself.

To summarize:
- **Throughput Units:** Costs for data ingestion and processing through Event Hubs.
- **Storage and Retention:** Costs for storing schemas and retaining them beyond the standard period.
- **Schema Registry:** No additional direct costs, but it is included as part of the Event Hubs service tier.

I hope this helps clarify things! If you have any more questions or need further details, feel free to ask.

===========

Yes, there are costs associated with performing lookups and fetching schemas from the Azure Schema Registry. These costs are generally tied to the number of read operations you perform to retrieve schemas.

### **Cost Components for Schema Registry Lookups:**
- **Read Operations:** Costs for each read operation to fetch a schema from the registry.
- **Throughput Units:** While the primary cost for throughput units is for data ingress and egress, read operations may also consume throughput units depending on the volume of schema lookups.

### **Example:**
If you perform 1,000 read operations to fetch schemas in a month, you would incur costs based on the number of read operations and the associated throughput units consumed.

For detailed pricing, it's best to refer to the [Azure Event Hubs Pricing Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/event-hubs/) or contact Azure support for a precise estimate based on your specific usage patterns.

Does this help clarify the costs involved?
