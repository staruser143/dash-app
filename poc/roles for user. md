Assigning Lake Formation Roles to UI App Users
You don't necessarily need to create an individual IAM user for each business user who wants to access the data through your UI app. Instead, you can leverage IAM roles and federated identity to provide secure access.
Here's a general approach:
 * Create IAM Roles:
   * Create IAM roles with the necessary Lake Formation permissions to access the desired data.
   * These roles should be aligned with the specific needs and privileges of different user groups within your organization.
 * Federate Identity:
   * Use a federated identity provider (IdP) like Amazon Cognito or a third-party IdP to authenticate users and issue temporary security credentials.
   * When a user logs into your UI app, the app can request temporary security credentials from the IdP.
   * These credentials can be used to assume the appropriate IAM role, granting the user the necessary permissions to access the data.
 * UI App Integration:
   * Configure your UI app to use the AWS SDK to assume the appropriate IAM role based on the user's authentication and authorization.
   * Once the role is assumed, the app can make API calls to AWS Glue Data Catalog and Redshift on behalf of the user, leveraging the permissions granted to the role.
Key Considerations:
 * Least Privilege Principle: Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to each role.
 * Regular Review: Regularly review and update IAM roles and permissions to ensure security and compliance.
 * Security Best Practices: Follow AWS security best practices to protect user credentials and data.
 * Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging to identify and address potential security issues.
 * Monitoring and Auditing: Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor and audit user activity, ensuring compliance with security policies.
By following these steps and considering the key points, you can effectively assign Lake Formation roles to your UI app users, providing secure and controlled access to your data.
