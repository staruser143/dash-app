Yes, using a database to store user-role mappings is a viable approach.
If you can't directly modify directory server attributes, you can create a separate database table to store the mapping between users and their corresponding Lake Formation roles. This database can be a traditional relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.
Here's a general approach:
 * Database Table: Create a table with columns like:
   * user_id (primary key)
   * lake_formation_role
 * Authentication and Role Fetching:
   * When a user authenticates, your UI app retrieves the user ID.
   * Query the database to fetch the associated Lake Formation role.
   * Use this role to assume the appropriate IAM role and access the data.
Key Considerations:
 * Security:
   * Encryption: Ensure sensitive information like user credentials is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
   * Access Control: Implement strong access controls to the database to protect user data.
   * Authentication: Use secure authentication mechanisms to access the database.
 * Performance:
   * Indexing: Create appropriate indexes on the user_id column to optimize query performance.
   * Caching: Consider caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
 * Scalability:
   * Design the database to handle increasing numbers of users and data.
   * Use a scalable database solution like a NoSQL database if necessary.
 * Synchronization:
   * Implement a mechanism to synchronize user-role mappings between the directory server and the database.
   * This could be done through automated scripts or manual updates.
Additional Considerations:
 * Centralized Configuration: Consider using a configuration management tool like AWS Parameter Store to store role mappings centrally.
 * Dynamic Role Assignment: Implement logic to dynamically assign roles based on user attributes or other criteria.
 * Monitoring and Logging: Monitor database access and performance, and log any security-related events.
By carefully designing and implementing this approach, you can effectively map users to Lake Formation roles, ensuring secure and controlled access to your data.
