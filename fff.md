Azure Functions and Azure Durable Functions are both serverless compute services, but they serve different purposes based on the complexity and execution patterns of the workloads. Here are examples to illustrate when each should be used:

1. Azure Functions (Stateless, Event-driven)

Azure Functions are best suited for scenarios where you need to execute simple, stateless, event-driven tasks that run in response to triggers, such as HTTP requests, queues, timers, or blob changes.

Examples:

HTTP API Endpoint: An Azure Function is ideal for exposing REST APIs. For example, an endpoint that processes a user registration request.

Use case: A user submits registration data via an HTTP request. The function validates the data, stores it in a database, and sends a confirmation email.


Queue Processing: An Azure Function triggered by a message in a queue can process the message and perform an action.

Use case: Process orders from a queue. Each order is picked from a queue, validated, and stored in a database.


Blob Storage Trigger: When a file is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, an Azure Function can process the file.

Use case: Automatically process images uploaded to a blob storage container, resizing them, or running OCR on them.



These use cases typically involve short-lived, independent tasks that don't require complex workflows.

2. Azure Durable Functions (Stateful, Orchestrated workflows)

Azure Durable Functions are designed for more complex workflows that require long-running, stateful orchestration of multiple function executions, particularly when tasks depend on each other or need to be paused and resumed.

Examples:

Chaining Functions: If your workflow involves running multiple functions in sequence where each function's result is needed by the next.

Use case: A function to process an order that needs to:

1. Charge a credit card.


2. Update inventory.


3. Send a confirmation email. Using Durable Functions, you can chain these tasks in a specific order and manage the state between them.




Human-Interaction Flow: When user interaction is required and the process must wait for a response before continuing.

Use case: A workflow that processes a loan application, where one of the steps requires human approval before moving forward with credit checks and documentation generation. The function can pause and resume based on the approval.


Fan-out/Fan-in: When you need to trigger multiple parallel tasks and then aggregate their results.

Use case: Processing different types of sensor data in parallel. For example, a weather forecasting system where you want to trigger parallel functions to analyze temperature, humidity, and wind data, then aggregate the results in a final function.


Timer-based Workflows: When tasks need to be delayed or periodically triggered, such as retries or scheduled reminders.

Use case: A service to periodically check if a task was completed and retry it after a specified delay if necessary. This is useful in scenarios like retrying failed payments, sending reminders, or monitoring system health.



When to Choose:

Azure Functions: For stateless, event-driven, simple tasks.

Azure Durable Functions: For complex workflows that involve multiple steps, long-running tasks, waiting for external input, or orchestrating parallel executions.


In summary, if you need a basic response to an event or trigger, go with Azure Functions. If your workflow requires persistence, state management, or coordination across multiple tasks or steps, choose Azure Durable Functions.
