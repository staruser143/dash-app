Absolutely! Let’s create a detailed cost-benefit analysis for Microsoft Fabric compared to a traditional Azure setup. Here's how I propose structuring it, followed by sample data and visualizations.

1. Assumptions and Inputs

We’ll start by defining the assumptions for a comparative analysis:

Customer Workload Assumptions

Data Size: 50 TB of data stored and processed monthly.

Users: 50 active users for BI (Power BI, dashboards).

Data Movement: 1 TB data moved between services monthly.

Compute Usage:

Data transformations (Data Factory): 300 hours/month.

Analytics queries (Synapse): 1,000 hours/month.


Services Used:

Traditional Setup: Azure Synapse, Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage, Power BI Pro.

Proposed Setup: Microsoft Fabric with comparable capacity.

2. Cost Analysis Framework

We compare costs for:

1. Data Storage


2. Data Integration (ETL/ELT)


3. Analytics Queries


4. BI and Visualization


5. Operational Overhead

3. Cost Breakdown

A. Data Storage


---

B. Data Integration (ETL/ELT)


---

C. Analytics Queries


---

D. BI and Visualization


---

E. Data Movement Costs


---

4. Total Cost Comparison

5. Qualitative Benefits

1. Simplified Management: No need for separate storage, compute, and BI services.


2. Faster Time-to-Market: Integrated workflows reduce time spent on integration.


3. Future-Readiness: Fabric supports AI-driven analytics natively, future-proofing the architecture.

6. Visual Representation

I can create:

1. Cost Comparison Chart: A bar chart showing the cost breakdown for the traditional setup vs. Fabric.


2. ROI Analysis Graph: A line graph showing cumulative costs over a year.


3. Savings Breakdown Pie Chart: Showing percentage savings by category.



Would you like me to generate these charts now? If so, I’ll proceed!
