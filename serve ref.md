Here’s a reference architecture tailored to the insurance domain focusing on the broker subdomain, incorporating Azure serverless services. This architecture is designed to enable broker management, data processing, and integration with external systems.


---

Reference Architecture Overview

1. Event Sources

Broker Data Uploads: Brokers upload policy documents, performance data, or claims via a portal.

Broker Management System (BMS): Events such as broker onboarding, policy updates, or commission calculations trigger workflows.

External CRM/ERP Systems: Integrations with Salesforce or SAP for customer and policy data synchronization.



---

Components

1. Front-End (Broker Portal)

Azure Static Web Apps

Hosts the broker-facing portal.

Brokers can upload documents, view commissions, and manage profiles.

API calls for dynamic data fetching are routed to backend services.



2. API Layer

Azure API Management

Securely exposes APIs for broker applications and external systems.

Provides rate-limiting, caching, and access control policies.




---

3. Event Handling

Azure Event Grid

Routes events such as:

Document uploads (to trigger processing workflows).

Policy updates (to notify brokers).


Publishes events to consumers like Azure Functions or Logic Apps.




---

4. Workflow Automation

Azure Logic Apps

Automates workflows like broker onboarding:

Verify documents using third-party APIs.

Send notifications to brokers and admins.


Integrates with external systems (e.g., Salesforce, SAP) to synchronize broker and policy data.




---

5. Serverless Compute

Azure Functions

Handles event-driven tasks like:

Document processing (e.g., extracting data from uploaded PDFs).

Real-time KPI calculations for broker performance.

Sending notifications or updates via email/SMS.


Scales dynamically based on the workload.


Azure Durable Functions

Orchestrates multi-step workflows like:

Calculating commissions from multiple data sources.

Chaining steps to process complex broker operations.





---

6. Data Storage

Azure Cosmos DB (Serverless Mode)

Stores real-time broker data such as:

Profiles, commission records, and policy details.


Enables querying for the broker portal and analytics.


Azure Blob Storage

Stores large files like policy documents, broker certificates, and reports.




---

7. Messaging and Integration

Azure Service Bus

Provides reliable messaging between services:

Decouples broker requests from long-running operations like commission processing.

Enables topic-based messaging for notifying specific brokers or groups.





---

8. Notifications

Azure Notification Hubs

Sends push notifications for real-time updates (e.g., commission disbursal, policy changes).




---

9. Analytics

Azure Synapse Analytics

Consumes data from Cosmos DB and Blob Storage for advanced analytics and reporting.

Generates insights for broker performance metrics, policy trends, and operational KPIs.




---

Workflow Example

Broker Onboarding Workflow

1. Broker uploads documents via the Static Web App.


2. Document upload triggers an Event Grid event.


3. Azure Function validates the document and metadata.


4. Logic App orchestrates the onboarding process:

Validates broker data via third-party APIs (e.g., ID checks).

Updates the broker profile in Cosmos DB.

Sends approval notifications using Notification Hubs.



5. Data is synchronized with external CRM systems via API Management.

Pros of This Architecture

Scalability: Fully serverless design ensures dynamic scaling based on workloads.

Integration: Native support for external systems like Salesforce, SAP, and Dynamics 365.

Cost-Effective: Pay-as-you-go model reduces costs during low-activity periods.

Resilience: Event-driven architecture decouples services, improving fault tolerance.



---

Cons and Mitigations

1. Cold Start Latency:

Mitigation: Use premium plans for Azure Functions for low latency.



2. Cost Complexity:

Multiple services might lead to cost fragmentation.

Mitigation: Use Azure Cost Management to monitor and optimize usage.



3. Vendor Lock-In:

Heavy reliance on Azure services can limit flexibility.

Mitigation: Use standard APIs and protocols where possible.
