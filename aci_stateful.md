You can run stateful workloads with Azure Container Instances (ACI), but it has limitations compared to services like AKS or Azure Container Apps. Here’s how stateful workloads work in ACI and the considerations to keep in mind:

Stateful Workloads in ACI

1. Storage Options:

ACI supports attaching Azure File shares and Azure Disks to containers.

These storage options allow containers to persist data beyond the container's lifecycle.

Data can be shared across multiple container instances if needed (e.g., using Azure Files).



2. Persistent Data:

Azure File shares can be mounted to ACI containers to store files persistently.

Azure Disks provide block-level storage for containers, but disks are tied to a specific instance.



3. Networking:

ACI supports integration with Azure Virtual Network, which allows access to stateful resources like databases or on-premises systems via secure network connections.



4. Restart Behavior:

ACI containers are stateless by default in terms of their lifecycle.

If a container stops or fails, it doesn’t automatically restart (unlike Kubernetes pods). This could interrupt stateful workloads unless managed externally (e.g., by re-deploying the container).

Limitations of Stateful Workloads in ACI

1. No Built-in Orchestration:

ACI doesn’t offer orchestration features like self-healing, automatic failover, or replicas, which are critical for resilient stateful workloads.

If a container fails, you need external monitoring or automation to redeploy it.



2. Scaling Challenges:

ACI doesn’t support autoscaling natively for stateful workloads. Scaling manually while ensuring storage consistency can be challenging.



3. Complex State Management:

Managing distributed state across multiple containers is not straightforward in ACI.

For example, if you need state replication, distributed storage, or leader election, ACI lacks these orchestration features.

Best Practices for Running Stateful Workloads in ACI

1. Leverage Azure Storage:

Use Azure Files for shared persistent storage or Azure Managed Disks for single-instance storage.

Ensure that containers mount the required storage during deployment.



2. Externalize State:

If possible, move the state to external services like Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage, or Azure Cosmos DB to simplify container restarts or scaling.



3. Add Automation:

Use Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or Azure DevOps pipelines to monitor and redeploy containers if they stop unexpectedly.



4. Combine with Other Azure Services:

Use ACI with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Apps for orchestration while running standalone stateful workloads on ACI when simplicity is needed.

When to Use ACI for Stateful Workloads

For short-lived, stateful tasks, such as data processing where the state persists temporarily during execution.

For applications with low fault-tolerance requirements and simple storage needs.

When you need quick deployment of stateful containers without managing a full cluster.

If You Need Advanced Stateful Workload Support

Use AKS if you require features like:

StatefulSets for managing stateful pods.

PersistentVolumeClaims for flexible storage management.

High availability and self-healing.


Consider Azure Container Apps for simpler use cases with externalized state and built-in scaling.
