Here's a feature comparison between Streamlit and Dash, two popular Python frameworks for building web applications, particularly in data science and machine learning:

Summary

Streamlit: Ideal for rapid prototyping, quick data visualization, and lightweight interactive apps for data science. It’s excellent for small to medium-sized applications where quick iterations are prioritized over complex functionality.

Dash: Better suited for building complex, production-ready applications. It’s especially strong in creating sophisticated dashboards that require custom layouts, interactivity, and enterprise-level features.


Both frameworks have their strengths, so your choice will depend on your project requirements, level of UI customization needed, and whether scalability and enterprise support are priorities.
