MongoDB Atlas provides several features for Change Streams, which allow applications to access real-time data changes without the complexity of tailing the oplog. Here are some key features:

1. **Real-Time Data Changes**: Applications can subscribe to changes on a single collection, database, or entire deployment.
2. **Aggregation Framework**: Change Streams use the aggregation framework, allowing developers to filter and transform change notifications.
3. **Resumability**: Change Streams maintain a resume token, enabling applications to resume listening for changes from the point where they left off.
4. **Event Notification**: Applications can react to data changes immediately, making it suitable for real-time applications.
5. **Multi-Region Support**: Change Streams are available for replica sets and sharded clusters, supporting deployments across multiple regions.
6. **Security**: Change Streams can be used with MongoDB's encryption-at-rest feature for secure data handling.
7. **Connection Management**: Change Streams handle connection losses gracefully by attempting to reconnect through another node in the cluster.

These features make MongoDB Atlas Change Streams a powerful tool for building real-time applications that need to react to data changes efficiently.
