To write a federated query in MongoDB Atlas that combines data from Azure Blob Storage with data from a MongoDB collection, you can use MongoDB's Atlas Data Federation. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### **Step 1: Configure Atlas Data Federation**
1. **Create a Federated Database Instance**:
   - In the MongoDB Atlas UI, go to the "Data Federation" section and create a new federated database instance.

2. **Add Azure Blob Storage as a Data Source**:
   - Configure the federated database instance to include Azure Blob Storage as a data source. Provide the necessary details such as the connection string, container name, and any authentication credentials.

3. **Define a Virtual Collection**:
   - Define a virtual collection that maps to the data in your Azure Blob Storage. For example, you might name it `azureData`.

### **Step 2: Write a Federated Query**
With the federated database instance and virtual collection set up, you can now write a query that joins data from the MongoDB collection and the Azure Blob Storage.

```javascript
use federatedDatabase;

// Example MongoDB collection query
const mongoData = db.orders.find({ /* query criteria */ }).toArray();

// Example Azure Blob Storage query
const azureData = db.azureData.find({ /* query criteria */ }).toArray();

// Combining data from both sources
const combinedData = mongoData.map(order => {
  const correspondingAzureRecord = azureData.find(record => record.customerId === order.customerId);
  return {
    ...order,
    azureInfo: correspondingAzureRecord ? correspondingAzureRecord.additionalData : null
  };
});

// Output combined data
printjson(combinedData);
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **MongoDB Collection Query**: Retrieve data from the `orders` collection based on your query criteria.
2. **Azure Blob Storage Query**: Retrieve data from the `azureData` virtual collection based on your query criteria.
3. **Combining Data**: Merge the data from both sources based on a common field, such as `customerId`, and create a combined result set.

### **Example with Aggregation Pipeline:**
You can also use the aggregation pipeline to perform more complex operations:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "azureData",
      localField: "customerId",
      foreignField: "customerId",
      as: "azureInfo"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$azureInfo"
  },
  {
    $match: {
      "status": "shipped"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      orderId: 1,
      customerId: 1,
      orderDate: 1,
      "azureInfo.additionalData": 1
    }
  }
]).toArray();
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **$lookup**: Joins the `orders` collection with the `azureData` virtual collection based on the `customerId` field.
2. **$unwind**: Deconstructs the `azureInfo` array to return a document for each element.
3. **$match**: Filters the documents based on specific criteria, such as `status`.
4. **$project**: Selects the fields to include in the final result.

This approach allows you to perform complex queries and aggregations using data from both MongoDB collections and Azure Blob Storage.

Does this help you understand how to write federated queries using MongoDB Atlas and Azure Blob Storage?
