We don't necessarily need to ingest data from Salesforce Data Cloud and Azure Cosmos DB collections into something like Azure Data Explorer (ADX) if our goal is to perform federated queries. With the capabilities provided by MongoDB Atlas Data Federation and Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, you can directly query the data from multiple sources without the need for data ingestion.

### **Direct Federated Queries:**
- **MongoDB Atlas Data Federation**: Allows you to query data in real-time from various sources, including MongoDB collections and external data sources like Salesforce Data Cloud. This approach provides up-to-date data without the need for data ingestion and synchronization.
- **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB**: Although it doesn't have a built-in federated query feature like Atlas Data Federation, you can use Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure Data Explorer to achieve similar results by querying data directly from multiple sources.

### **Advantages:**
- **Real-Time Access**: Directly query the most current data from the source.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Avoid additional storage costs associated with data ingestion.
- **Simplified Data Management**: Eliminate the complexity of ETL processes and synchronization.

### **When to Consider Data Ingestion:**
- **Performance Optimization**: If you require low-latency access and frequent querying, ingesting data into a local store like ADX can improve performance.
- **Complex Data Integration**: For complex data transformations and integrations, an ETL process might be necessary.

### **Conclusion:**
While federated queries provide a flexible and efficient way to access data from multiple sources, there are scenarios where data ingestion may still be beneficial for performance and complex integrations. However, for many use cases, the ability to query data directly from the source without ingestion offers significant advantages.
