Apache Iceberg is well-suited to handle data with unpredictable changes, such as Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs), due to its flexible schema management, snapshot-based storage, and support for row-level updates. In data warehousing and analytics, SCDs often require special handling to track historical changes alongside current values, and Iceberg’s features allow for efficient management of these changes.

Here’s how Iceberg tables address SCD requirements:

1. Handling Different SCD Types

Type 1 (Overwrite with New Data): In Type 1 SCD, new data simply overwrites the existing data, without preserving history.

With Iceberg, you can handle Type 1 by using simple UPDATE operations or by overwriting partitions directly. Iceberg’s snapshot isolation ensures that the updates are atomic and that readers will see a consistent view.

Example:

# Update operation in Spark for Type 1 SCD
spark.sql("""
    UPDATE my_table SET address = 'New Address'
    WHERE customer_id = '123'
""")


Type 2 (Add New Rows for Each Change): Type 2 SCD requires adding a new row with each change, maintaining history.

Iceberg is ideal for this use case because it allows for appending rows efficiently while tracking each change at the row level.

You can add new rows with effective and expiration date columns to mark historical records, making queries straightforward and performant.

Example:

# Append new row for Type 2 SCD to record a change
new_record = spark.createDataFrame([(123, 'John Doe', 'Old Address', 'New Address', '2024-11-01')], 
                                   ["customer_id", "name", "old_address", "new_address", "effective_date"])
new_record.writeTo("my_table").append()


Type 3 (Track Limited Historical Attributes): Type 3 SCD involves adding new columns to store prior values.

Iceberg supports schema evolution, so you can easily add columns to store historical values without rewriting existing data. This provides flexibility to track specific changes without duplicating rows.

Example: Add a new column for “previous address” if you need to store it alongside the current address:

spark.sql("""
    ALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMN previous_address STRING
""")



2. Schema Evolution for Managing Changes

Iceberg’s schema evolution features make it easy to adjust your table schema as requirements change, such as adding new columns for tracking changes in specific attributes.

Unlike traditional formats, Iceberg schema changes do not require a full table rewrite or affect existing data, making it efficient to adapt to evolving data structures common with SCDs.


3. Efficient Data Partitioning and Partition Evolution

Iceberg tables support flexible partitioning by any column, including date or version columns, to organize data based on change frequency or SCD type.

Iceberg also supports partition evolution, meaning that partitioning strategies can be changed over time without rewriting the table. This is especially useful for SCDs, as you can start with one partitioning strategy and adapt as the data volume grows or change frequency varies.


Example:

Initially, you might partition by a low-cardinality column like region.

As data grows, you could evolve the partitioning scheme to include effective_date to optimize queries on historical data.


4. Time Travel for Historical Data Retrieval

Iceberg’s time travel feature allows you to query historical versions of the table at specific points in time. This is particularly useful for SCDs, as you can access previous snapshots to view the data before certain changes occurred.

This enables SCD implementations without needing to keep separate tables for current and historical data.


Example in Spark (AWS Glue or EMR):

# Retrieve table as it was on a specific date
spark.sql("""
    SELECT * FROM my_table
    TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-10-01 00:00:00'
""")

5. Row-Level Updates and Deletes

Iceberg supports row-level updates and deletes, which are essential for maintaining SCDs where individual records need to be updated or logically deleted without impacting the rest of the table.

This row-level functionality enables efficient handling of data changes while preserving historical data, and it avoids expensive, full-table rewrites that can occur with some other formats.


Example of Row-Level Update:

spark.sql("""
    DELETE FROM my_table WHERE customer_id = '123' AND effective_date = '2024-10-01'
""")

6. Metadata Management for Tracking Changes

Iceberg stores metadata in separate files, allowing for efficient query planning and data skipping. This metadata management helps to identify and retrieve only the relevant data files needed for SCD queries.

Using metadata and partition pruning, Iceberg can efficiently handle queries that need to access specific versions or rows, reducing the I/O required to scan the table and making SCD queries faster.


Summary

Iceberg tables on AWS provide robust support for Slowly Changing Dimensions by enabling efficient data modifications, flexible schema evolution, time travel for historical data access, and optimized partitioning. These features make Iceberg a strong choice for handling SCDs in data lakes, where data structures and requirements can be highly dynamic.
