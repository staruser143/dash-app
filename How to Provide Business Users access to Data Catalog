No, business users do not necessarily need individual AWS accounts or IAM users. There are several ways to provide access without creating a direct AWS user account for each individual:

---

### **1. Centralized Access Control with Federated Identity Management**
Instead of creating individual IAM users for each business user, you can use **federation** with a centralized identity provider (IdP), such as:

- **Active Directory (AD)**
- **Okta**
- **Azure AD**
- **AWS Cognito**

These IdPs allow users to log in with their existing business credentials (e.g., company email and password). The IdP maps users to IAM roles dynamically, providing secure and temporary access to AWS services.

#### **Key Benefits:**
- Centralized user management (no need to create or delete users in AWS directly).
- Business users access AWS services via roles without permanent credentials.
- Temporary access tokens (using AWS Security Token Service, STS) are issued.

### **2. Use Lake Formation with IAM Roles**
Lake Formation permissions are typically tied to **IAM roles**, which business users assume temporarily. This setup does not require creating AWS users for each individual.

#### **How It Works:**
1. Create IAM roles in AWS for each group or persona (e.g., "Analyst," "Data Scientist").
2. Map business users or groups from your IdP to these roles.
   - Example: An "Analyst" group in your IdP maps to a specific IAM role in AWS.
3. When a user logs in through the IdP, they automatically assume the appropriate role.

### **3. Application Proxy for Indirect Access**
If business users don't need direct access to the AWS Management Console or APIs, you can create a **proxy application**:

- Develop a custom interface (e.g., a web app using Dash or another framework) that interacts with AWS services on behalf of users.
- The application authenticates the user and enforces access policies internally.
- AWS resources are accessed using a single IAM role for the application, not individual user accounts.

#### Example Use Case:
- A business user logs into a dashboard application.
- The dashboard queries Redshift tables governed by Lake Formation using the application's IAM role.
- Permissions are enforced based on the user's profile in the application.

### **4. Sharing Access via Redshift Database Users**
For users who need access only to Redshift:
- You can manage access using **Redshift database users and groups**, without giving users direct AWS access.
- Combine this with IAM roles for querying external data (e.g., Glue cataloged tables):
  - Business users access Redshift using database credentials.
  - The database itself is configured with IAM roles for Glue/Lake Formation interactions.

### **5. AWS Service-Specific Solutions**
Certain AWS services provide built-in mechanisms for granting access without creating IAM users:
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Allows users to analyze data without direct AWS access. Permissions are granted at the dataset level, and QuickSight handles user access.
- **Athena Federated Query**: Business users can query data via Athena and Lake Formation without requiring AWS access, often through federated authentication.

---

### **6. Consideration for Temporary Users**
For external collaborators or temporary users:
- Use **IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO)** to provide limited, temporary access.
- Set an expiration policy for roles or sessions.

---

### **Recommendation**
For scalability, security, and ease of management:
1. Use **federation with an IdP** (e.g., Active Directory or Okta).
2. Map users or groups to IAM roles.
3. Use Lake Formation for fine-grained permissions.
4. Optionally, abstract access via a custom application or service like QuickSight.
