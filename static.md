Yes, you can host and serve a static web application using Azure Blob Storage! It is a cost-effective and straightforward way to host static websites, especially for simpler scenarios. Here's a comparison and detailed explanation of how Azure Blob Storage works for static site hosting versus using Azure Static Web Apps:

Hosting Static Apps on Azure Blob Storage

How It Works

1. Static Website Hosting

Azure Blob Storage provides a feature to enable static website hosting.

You upload your static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to a designated container (typically named $web).



2. Global Access via HTTP/HTTPS

The files are served over HTTP/HTTPS using a public endpoint.



3. Custom Domain and SSL

You can map a custom domain to the storage endpoint and use Azure Front Door or Azure CDN for SSL certificates.

Steps to Host a Static Website in Azure Blob Storage

1. Create a Storage Account

Use the Azure portal, CLI, or SDK to create a storage account.



2. Enable Static Website Hosting

In the storage account settings, enable "Static Website" hosting and specify the index and error documents (e.g., index.html and 404.html).



3. Upload Files

Upload your static website files to the $web container in the storage account.



4. Access Your Site

Once deployed, the static website is available at a public URL like:
https://<storage_account_name>.z13.web.core.windows.net.



5. Custom Domain & SSL

Use Azure CDN or Front Door to configure a custom domain with HTTPS.

Use Cases for Blob Storage Static Hosting

1. Simple Websites

Blogs, portfolios, or landing pages without any server-side logic.



2. Cost-Sensitive Deployments

Applications where the focus is on minimizing costs (no need for CI/CD, serverless APIs, or authentication).



3. Integration with Azure CDN

You can combine Azure Blob Storage with Azure CDN for improved performance and custom domain support.





---

When to Use Azure Static Web Apps Instead

You need serverless APIs integrated directly with the web app.

You require built-in CI/CD for automatic deployments from GitHub or Azure DevOps.

You want authentication and authorization baked into the hosting platform.

You have a Single Page Application (SPA) that requires advanced routing support.

Example: Broker Portal on Blob Storage

If your broker portal is a purely static SPA with no backend APIs, you can:

1. Build the app using frameworks like React or Vue.js.


2. Deploy it to Azure Blob Storage's $web container.


3. Use Azure CDN to enable fast, global delivery and custom domains with HTTPS.



However, if you need dynamic functionality (e.g., real-time commission calculations, user authentication, or event-driven workflows), then Azure Static Web Apps with integrated Azure Functions is a better choice.
