When integrating Salesforce with a data platform in Azure, such as Microsoft Fabric, you can connect to Salesforce through various APIs, depending on your use case. Below are the main types of Salesforce APIs you can use:

1. REST API:

Ideal for lightweight integrations and real-time communication.

Provides access to Salesforce data (e.g., records, objects, and metadata) over HTTP.

Suitable for CRUD operations, querying records using SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language), and managing user sessions.

Great for scenarios requiring integration with modern, RESTful services in the cloud.



2. SOAP API:

Typically used for more robust integrations requiring strict data structures and formal communication.

Supports bulk data operations and provides synchronous and asynchronous processing options.

Works well with enterprise-level integrations, legacy systems, and situations that need a more structured message format than REST.



3. Bulk API:

Designed for large-scale data operations, like importing, exporting, or deleting large volumes of records.

Uses REST principles but optimizes for high-volume data processing (typically used in batch operations).

Can be useful for migrating data or syncing massive datasets with the data platform.



4. Streaming API:

Allows you to receive real-time notifications about changes in Salesforce data (such as updates, deletes, or inserts).

Uses CometD for pushing data updates to external systems.

Suitable for scenarios where you need to keep data in sync or track events in real-time.



5. GraphQL API:

A relatively newer addition that enables you to query Salesforce data in a more flexible way compared to REST.

Allows you to specify exactly what data you need, making it efficient for reducing the volume of data transferred.

Ideal for modern applications that need more granular control over queries and responses.



6. Apex REST API:

Allows you to expose custom business logic and data models via REST endpoints.

Useful if you need to expose custom Salesforce logic or data structures to an external system.

You can write custom Apex classes to define the endpoints and operations needed for integration.



7. Metadata API:

Provides access to Salesforce metadata, such as objects, fields, page layouts, and other configuration settings.

Useful when you need to manage or retrieve the structure and schema of Salesforce configurations.

More applicable for deployment processes, version control, and schema migrations rather than data operations.



8. Connect API (Chatter API):

Specifically designed to interact with Salesforce Chatter features, such as posts, groups, and users.

If your data platform needs to interact with Salesforce social features, this API is valuable.




Integration Considerations:

Authentication: You'll need OAuth 2.0 or other supported authentication mechanisms to securely connect with Salesforce APIs.

Data Sync: Depending on your integration's complexity, you may want to use a combination of REST API for real-time updates, Bulk API for large-scale data movements, and Streaming API for event-driven data syncs.


For integrating Salesforce with Microsoft Fabric on Azure, you can leverage Azure Data Factory or Logic Apps, which can use REST and SOAP APIs to pull data from Salesforce into the Azure ecosystem, transform it, and load it into the data platform. You can also use services like Azure Functions to process real-time data from Salesforce using Streaming API.
