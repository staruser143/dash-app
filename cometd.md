The decision to use direct real-time subscription (via CometD) versus Platform Events or Change Data Capture (CDC) with triggers depends on your use case, system requirements, and integration preferences. Below is a detailed comparison and guidance to help you choose the right approach:


---

1. Direct Real-Time Subscription (CometD)

How It Works:

Direct subscription to Salesforce Streaming API channels using a CometD client.

Typically used with:

PushTopics for SOQL-based event tracking.

CDC (Change Data Capture) for object-level change tracking.

Generic Events for custom event delivery.



When to Use:

1. No Salesforce Trigger Logic or Workflow Automation:

When you want to consume events directly without involving triggers, Process Builder, or Flow in Salesforce.

Example: A lightweight external system needs to listen for updates to Salesforce data but doesn’t need complex business logic in Salesforce.



2. Dynamic Subscriptions:

When you need to create, update, or remove subscriptions dynamically at runtime.

Example: A system that monitors different datasets on demand (e.g., changing PushTopic queries).



3. High-Volume Event Processing:

When you want direct, efficient, and low-latency event processing for large-scale applications.

Example: A data lake ingestion pipeline that handles thousands of changes per second from Salesforce.



4. Custom Processing Logic in External Systems:

When you prefer to handle all business logic outside Salesforce.

Example: Event-driven microservices architecture running in Azure.



5. Legacy or Non-Supported Objects:

When you need real-time events for objects not natively supported by Platform Events or CDC.

Example: Custom objects or fields requiring SOQL-based tracking via PushTopics.




Advantages:

Real-time updates with minimal delay.

Full control over event processing in the external system.

No dependency on Salesforce automation tools (e.g., triggers).


Challenges:

Requires maintaining a CometD client on the consumer side, adding complexity.

Limited to Salesforce Streaming API usage limits (e.g., API quotas, concurrent connections).

No built-in retry mechanism—failure handling must be custom-built.

2. Platform Events

How It Works:

Salesforce publishes custom events via the Platform Events framework.

Consumers subscribe to these events via triggers, Process Builder, Flow, or API-based solutions.


When to Use:

1. Custom Event Payloads:

When you need to send highly customized event payloads to external systems.

Example: Including additional metadata or fields not directly tied to Salesforce records.



2. Decoupled Event-Driven Architecture:

When you want Salesforce to act as a producer of events without worrying about the consumers.

Example: Multiple external systems (e.g., Azure Functions, Kafka, MuleSoft) subscribing to the same event stream.



3. Complex Event Logic:

When you need Salesforce triggers or workflows to determine when and what data is sent.

Example: Trigger an event only after specific conditions are met (e.g., "send data when a deal is closed").



4. Integration Middleware:

When you want to use middleware (e.g., MuleSoft, Zapier) or Azure Event Grid to fan out the events to multiple systems.

Example: An e-commerce system updates order status in Salesforce, which triggers downstream updates to ERP and analytics systems.




Advantages:

Flexible and customizable payloads.

Built-in support for replaying events (within a 72-hour retention window).

Easy integration with external systems using standard API methods or middleware.


Challenges:

Higher cost and additional API calls for event usage.

Event size and volume limits (e.g., max 1 MB payload per event).

3. Change Data Capture (CDC) with Triggers

How It Works:

Salesforce CDC automatically publishes change events for supported standard and custom objects.

External systems subscribe to these events either via CometD or using triggers to forward data via HTTP POST.


When to Use:

1. Out-of-the-Box Change Tracking:

When you need a simple way to track changes (create, update, delete, or undelete) in Salesforce objects.

Example: Syncing Salesforce contacts with an external CRM in real-time.



2. Integration with Azure Functions/HTTP Endpoints:

When you need to forward change events directly to external systems using triggers or Process Builder.

Example: Sending account updates to Azure SQL using an HTTP POST trigger.



3. Low-Latency, High-Reliability Sync:

When you need reliable, low-latency sync for specific objects.

Example: Keeping Salesforce accounts and an external customer database synchronized in near real-time.



4. Standard Object Support:

When you need real-time updates for Salesforce standard objects (e.g., Accounts, Opportunities).

Example: Automatically update an external marketing platform when leads are updated in Salesforce.




Advantages:

Native support for tracking create, update, delete, and undelete operations.

Reliable delivery with event replay capabilities (72 hours).

Simplifies integration for common change-tracking scenarios.


Challenges:

Limited to Salesforce CDC-supported objects.

Event payload is predefined and may not include all required fields—additional API calls might be needed to fetch related data.

Choosing the Right Approach

Use Direct Real-Time Subscription when:

You need fine-grained control over how events are consumed.

You are dealing with legacy systems or custom workflows where Salesforce automation tools aren't suitable.

You require dynamic subscriptions to different data sets.


Use Platform Events when:

You need a decoupled event-driven architecture.

You want to include custom metadata or additional fields in event payloads.

You need to fan out events to multiple systems with ease.


Use CDC with Triggers when:

You need real-time tracking of changes in Salesforce data.

Your focus is on synchronizing objects between Salesforce and external systems.

You prefer minimal custom development and are working with standard Salesforce objects.
